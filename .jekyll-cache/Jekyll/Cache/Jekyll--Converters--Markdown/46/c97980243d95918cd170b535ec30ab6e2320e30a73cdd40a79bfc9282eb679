I"É<p>Itâ€™s a simple and complicated question. Simple to the fact of asking; complex in the regards of answering. To each person time flies in different ways. For some, itâ€™s a matter of mood. There are theories that when you are happiest time flies the quickest, yet Iâ€™ve heard the exact opposite from others. Some Iâ€™ve spoken with believe it to be a complete and utter random occurrence, and others believe that the perception of time is only a choice. So really, itâ€™s all in how you see it. Time is a guideline that from the time of birth we are told exists. I think itâ€™s like the hypothesis, that everyone sees the same colour differently. We all say that green is green, but if you could see using your friendsâ€™ brain, would green be purple? Itâ€™s the notion that our brains have adapted to its environment and to its lessons. Each body is different and so each brain controls it differently. Itâ€™s like driving a new car, itâ€™s the same, you go from A to Z on wheels and in a straight line, but the interior and handling are always differentâ€¦</p>
