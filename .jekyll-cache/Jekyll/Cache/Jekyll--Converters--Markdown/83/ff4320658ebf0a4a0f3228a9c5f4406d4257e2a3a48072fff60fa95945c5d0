I" <p>Well, this morning I had a chance to catch up on some blog reading. When youâ€™ve got so many subscribed, itâ€™s easy for the unread ones to pile up. And this morning it seemed that every post I was reading had some mention to a novel: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/qid=1106033518/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-4436122-3309904">Blink</a>. So I used it as a sign and went out to purchase it. And Iâ€™m glad I did. Iâ€™m half way through already, and itâ€™s a page turner into the unconscious mind. And now posts like Tom Peterâ€™s â€œ<a href="http://tompeters.com/2005/01/the-eye-sparkle-factor/">Eye Sparkle Factor</a>â€ make so much sense.</p>
