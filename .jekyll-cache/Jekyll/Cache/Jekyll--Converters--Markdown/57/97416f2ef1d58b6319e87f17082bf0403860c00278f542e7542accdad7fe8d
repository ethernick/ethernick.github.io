I"é<p>So Iâ€™m drinking my starbucks and I read on the back of their cup</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chances are you are scared of fictions. Chances are you are only fleetingly happy. Chances are you know
much less than you think you do. Chances are you feel a little guilty. Chances are you want people to lie
to you. Perhaps the answer lies on the side of a coffee cup. You are lost. - David Cross, Comedian</p>

<p>This is from a comedianâ€¦soâ€¦is this supposed to be funny?</p>
