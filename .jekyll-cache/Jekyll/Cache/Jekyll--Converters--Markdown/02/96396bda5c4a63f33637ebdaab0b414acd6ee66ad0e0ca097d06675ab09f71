I"%<p>Came across Last.fm because one morning I had a great Idea. “How ’bout a community website, where people can upload music and share them?” I thought to myself.
Shortly after looking around I raised my fist in the air “Damn you!” Not only has this been done, it’s been done very well. So well in fact, that not shortly after, I made the biggest compliment. I gave money; not because someone called me begging, but because I felt it was a worthy cause.</p>
