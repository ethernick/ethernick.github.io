I"A<p>Some 600 or so pages, some laughing and crying, I’m done the newest installment of Harry Potter. I’m starting 
to think that there is some sort of addiction there. I actually used up some bank time at work, so I could go 
home early to finish it…is that a problem? I guess the problem would be if I didn’t even call into work and 
just stayed home.</p>

<p>Part of the homework from <a href="/who-are-we">The Chrysalis</a> is that we are to come up with 10 things that resonate 
and encourage our creativity and then do 3. The timing for the new book was almost kismet because 1 down and 
2 to go. Sure, I’m haven’t quite figured out what they are…I’ve still got 9 things besides reading to come 
up with…but, when I do, I’ll do 2 of them and homework done. i’ve only got, what, 3 days left to do them?</p>
