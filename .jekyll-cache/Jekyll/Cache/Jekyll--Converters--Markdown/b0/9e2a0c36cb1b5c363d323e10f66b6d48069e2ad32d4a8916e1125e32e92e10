I"-<p>I don’t know who they are, but I’m sending out a nice thank you to the 3 people who thought my collection of poems were good enough to purchase. Sure it’s been a couple of months since I submitted 4 copies, but considering the competition on the shelves I’m pretty stoked about that. So to the universe I scream, thank you!

<p>I have a thought that’s purple<br />
Well, it’s more purple with orange swirls<br />
It’s kinda Happy<br />
It’s kinda Angry<br />
It’s like daisies in the spring<br />
and Bears in the winter</p>
