I"½<p>December blahâ€™s have been hitting. Havenâ€™t really been feeling so hot lately. Not too sure why. I think today is better. Got some things off my shoulders and now I think Iâ€™m actually starting to make progress on my little secret site. Itâ€™s not really a secret. And for someone who is looking at being out there and open itâ€™s not really a good idea for me not to say anything.</p>

<p>Well the site is wherestheshow.com itâ€™s going to be an event calendar. Right now itâ€™s not much of anything, but on my localhost itâ€™s starting to come somewhere. Mind you itâ€™s taking forever!! I just need to keep taking in big breathes and remind myself of baby steps. Baby steps. Baby steps.</p>
