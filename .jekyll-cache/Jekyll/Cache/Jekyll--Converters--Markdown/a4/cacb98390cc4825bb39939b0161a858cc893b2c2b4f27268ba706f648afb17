I"¤<p>Iâ€™ve heard a rumour that some people donâ€™t use a news aggregator like Google Reader. RSS might as well sand for â€œ<strong>R</strong>eally itâ€™s <strong>S</strong>omething <strong>S</strong>trangeâ€. And for those of you who come by once in a while hoping for something new and heart broken to see the same post as before, I send my apologies your way. But Iâ€™m not one just to say sorry and forget about it. I like to correct the problem. Iâ€™ve added the ability to subscribe to my blog. No longer do you need to pop by and hope. If you sign up, Iâ€™ll send you an email and let you know Iâ€™ve made a change. Think of it like an invitation for Pie or Coffee.</p>
