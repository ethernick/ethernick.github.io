I"Ÿ<p>So Iâ€™ve finally come to the conclusion that networking through the web isnâ€™t a cup of tea for me. Matter of 
fact it isnâ€™t even a cup of anything for me. Iâ€™m not in it. For me itâ€™s too forced and not natural enough. I 
did go to one of the meet-ups but didnâ€™t really get into it. Iâ€™m sure there are other meet-ups that are 
great, but right now in my life, not for me. Soâ€¦the links are gone.</p>
