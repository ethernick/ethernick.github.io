I"º<p>Got my recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060127004744/http://www.iconoculture.com/">iconoculture</a>
in the mail. They had a piece about thinknets: cyber communities of thinktanks.
In particular it referenced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060127004744/http://www.massivechange.com/">Massive Change</a>
which is striving to be one of these. Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060127004744/http://forums.massivechange.com/index.php">forum</a>
has some interesting topics. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s at the super â€œthinktankâ€ level
yet, like the conscious city or anything like that, but it has good potential.
Iâ€™m keeping a watch on it. Maybe make a post or 2.</p>
