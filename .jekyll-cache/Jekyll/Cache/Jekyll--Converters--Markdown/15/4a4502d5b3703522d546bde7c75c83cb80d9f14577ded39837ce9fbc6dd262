I"Á<p>Ah, Valentines day. In waking up this morning I walked to my computer only to find all the bloggers in the world taking a moment in their life to celebrate love and joy. Well, for me Iâ€™m going to make a post for us lonely out there.</p>

<p>I get the idea of love, and I sure do appreciate those who have it, but with all the hype and publicity of the day, itâ€™s an amplifier to the fact that this morning when I rolled over in bed, their wasnâ€™t anyone there. Itâ€™s a reminder that as Iâ€™m talking in my living room, only my cat will meow back. Itâ€™s a day, where all the memories of Valentines Dayâ€™s past are played in my head and how this year itâ€™s solo. Not a good feeling at first, but like anything else, practice makes perfect. Or is it time heals? So, I make due and try and remind myself that Iâ€™m my own Valentine.</p>

<p>I suggest to all those out there who arenâ€™t liking today, to be proud and go to a movie and only buy 1 ticket. Go to dinner and say â€œfor 1â€³. To have a date with yourself. I think sometimes itâ€™s easy to show someone else how much you love them. But I think the real courage and challenge is to show how much you love yourself. Buy yourself something you want. Do something youâ€™ve always wanted to do. For me, Iâ€™ve found I enjoy taking a long walk by myself. I stroll and ponder. I use this time to remind myself about things that I want to accomplish. I ask myself, â€œif Iâ€™m going to be alone for the rest of my life, what will make me happy and complete.â€ I suggest everyone, regardless of companionship status ask themselves this question. So, my jacket and shoes are on, and once I click â€œpublishâ€ for this post, Iâ€™m off and walking. Happy Valentines.</p>
