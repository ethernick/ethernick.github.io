I"1<p>What a quote…only <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/">George</a> can get away with saying that in the news.</p>

<p>But in seeing this, it makes me think just a little. Could something like that happen with today’s generations? This is a secret that was kept by 4 people for 30 years. It would have been easy for the reports or the editor just to stand up and give it away, but they “promised” to keep the secret.</p>

<p>I sure as hell don’t have an inkling into an answer, but I sure will ask the question. Do promises and vows still exist?</p>
