I"ğ<p>This past week my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060210032452/http://www.fastcompany.com/cof/">Company of Friends Group</a> was discussing aspects and thoughts towards Networking. <a href="https://www.stewart-marshall.com/">Stewart Marshall</a> has learned some great lessons and shared them with us, and the conversations that ensued were interesting and eye opening for me.</p>

<p>The best aspect I took from our conversations was the misplaced negative stereo-type people have created over the years about networking. Iâ€™m not exactly sure how and when this happened but I know I had this idea until this conversation. the term â€œNetworkingâ€ for me conjured images of fake smiles and fake hand shakes. Giving your card out to thousands of people and knowing only 1% might actually keep it. I found myself surprised that concepts and principles in networking are the exact same I use to make friends. It all comes down to meeting new people, however weâ€™ve found that we can do that, use it.</p>

<p>So as a learning and growing project, and being an internet person, Iâ€™ve decided to start linking in through various networking sites and to give them a try. Iâ€™ll be adding the Networking sub-category to my Business Category, and as I learn about these sites and explore, Iâ€™ll definitely be keeping everyone in the loop.</p>

<p><small>Side Note:: This also keeps in line with this new concept of <a href="/chaos-equals-creativity">chaos theory</a>. New People = Unexpected = Chaos.</small></p>
