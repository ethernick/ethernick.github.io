I"0<p>Hat’s off to all of those who create.</p>

<p>I commend all of you who produce something with any form of regularity.</p>

<p>It’s my weakness.</p>

<p>You do it through all the excuses. Through exhaustion. Through nervousness.
Through repetition. Through drinks with friends. Through desires to binge watch. Through child vomit.
Through partners to-do’s. Through bill payments. Through little voices inside your head. Through sickness.
Through happiness. Through fear. Through success. Through confusion. Through it all.</p>

<p>You hit publish.</p>
