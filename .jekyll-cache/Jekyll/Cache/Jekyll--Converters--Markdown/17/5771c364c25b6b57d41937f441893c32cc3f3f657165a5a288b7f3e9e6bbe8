I"a<p>Iâ€™ve been obsesed for the past 2 weeks hunting for a replacement of Digg Reader. Found it 
in <a href="https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/tt-rss/wiki">Tiny Tiny RSS</a>.</p>

<p>I feel so much better, now that I have my own feed of things to read daily. Under my own control, with my own choices. No AI
deciding and filtering what I should be reading.</p>
