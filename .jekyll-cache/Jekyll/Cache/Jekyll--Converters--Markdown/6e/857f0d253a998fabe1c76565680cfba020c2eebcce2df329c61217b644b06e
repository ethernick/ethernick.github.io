I"î<p>I feel incredible! I needed to yell that out into the virtual world. Why? This weekend I had the pleasure of being a child again. I went to camp. Yes Camp. It was like an intense condensed summer camp. All thanks to those at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060111113748/http://www.creativetoolbox.ca:80/">Creative Toolbox</a> for the experience.
The camp was called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050308002304/http://www.creativetoolbox.ca:80/programs2005/creativecamp/creativecampexperience.php">The Creative Camp Experience</a>. and it live up to it‚Äôs name and more. It was a shmorgishborg of people with different knowledge and experiences, yet funnelled to the same goal of helping creativity.</p>

<p>I did things I didn‚Äôt think I could; talk to people I didn‚Äôt think I would; felt things I haven‚Äôt felt; remembered things that were locked away. It was beautiful. Everywhere I turned their were connections. The first night, I found out that one of the owners grew up in the same town as me, and graduated from the same high-school. That might not be so surprising if we were in Guelph, Ontario, however we were in Chilliwack, BC.</p>

<p>It helped me show that when I am tapping into my creativity, there are no coincidences or ‚Äúchance‚Äù happenings. Somehow it all happens and turns out in a way you can‚Äôt explain. And along the way, there will be connections. There are a whack of meta-physical ways this could be explained. I‚Äôm not going to explain it like that. The best way is, ‚Äúleap and the net will catch you‚Äù.</p>

<p>If you get the opportunity to go to a camp organized by Creative Toolbox, I strongly suggest you go, and enjoy!</p>
