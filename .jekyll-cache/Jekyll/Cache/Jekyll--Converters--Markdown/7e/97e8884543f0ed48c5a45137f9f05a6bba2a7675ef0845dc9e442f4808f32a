I"j<p>Some call it bastardization; some call it social degradation. I call it evolution. Today I was reading an 
article about the internet savvy Chinese. They have adapted various puns when on the internet. Take ‘88′, to 
us english speaking crackers it’s just a number; even to the formal trained linguist of the orient, it’s a 
number. But not for the text messengers. It turns out ‘8′ is pronounced ba. So put two 8’s together and you 
get ba-ba. Sounds a lot like inky or winky ( or whatever the teletubbies names are) say goodbye right before 
jumping down their trippy little rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I say good on them. It’s like vulgar language of the 60’s and like the ‘n’ word for Dave Chappelle and rap. 
It’s evolution, it’s word play. There has always been a verbal and written language. Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana">Carmina 
Burana</a>. A bunch of young teens writing in the formal written 
verse about sex and drugs and alcohol (Gasp!) ? And Shakespeare inventing words that are still used to this day, oh my!</p>

<p>People need to play with language, they need to experiment and try new things. Hell english alone is one of 
the choppiest, band-aide languages out there. And it’s evolving. And just because people are using it in 
internet slang doesn’t mean it will end up being formal. Do you think for a moment that the common folk of 
the late 1500’s - early 1600’s actually spoke like the play’s? No…but they understood, just like we do now. 
So I say good for them, and good for all of those out there that are pioneers and play with words.</p>
