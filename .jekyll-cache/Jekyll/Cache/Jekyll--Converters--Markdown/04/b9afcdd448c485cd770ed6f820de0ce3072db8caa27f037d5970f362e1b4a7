I"æ<p>Today <a href="http://changethis.com/">Change This</a>: the fight club of the business world, launched itâ€™s first set of manifestos. Iâ€™ve only had a chance to read the first one, â€œ<a href="http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/1.ArtOfTheStart">The Art of the Start</a>â€ by Guy Kawasaki. I liked what it had to say. Iâ€™m still soaking in everything, but it comes at a good time for me. With me planning on diving into the world headlong by my own, this information comes to me at a very good time. <a href="/theyre-all-going-to-talk-about-you">Originally</a> I had a bit of me being skeptical. Iâ€™m still looking to read the others, but so far so good. So, Iâ€™m doing my bit, to spread the word. Read On, my friends, read on.</p>
