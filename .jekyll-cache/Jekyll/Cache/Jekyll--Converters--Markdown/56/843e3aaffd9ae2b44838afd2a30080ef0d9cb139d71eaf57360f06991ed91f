I"Ü<p>As I mentioned in my first <a href="/new-leaf">post</a>, I put in my resignation at work. Itâ€™s an extremely liberating experience. But unlike others, I put in 3 months notice. At work I do a billion and 3 things. Iâ€™ve created that niche position just for me and Iâ€™ve become â€œirreplaceableâ€. Which really means, there is no way in hell Iâ€™m ever going to be able to get a new position at least at the company I work for now. So when the window of opportunity open I said â€œwhy notâ€. Now the interesting things about it all is the reactions. There are people who are thrilled for me leaving, some arenâ€™t but happy, there are the people who honestly donâ€™t care, and then there are the people who donâ€™t talk to me anymore. Itâ€™s funny to here the reaction or when people start the conversation as â€œI heard a little rumourâ€¦â€ or â€œSay it ainâ€™t soâ€. I havenâ€™t told anyone who hasnâ€™t come to me with it first. Itâ€™s actually becoming my little interest to see where the rumour mill is going next.</p>

<p>I always considered myself open and receptive enough to look at the whole picture. To really see how people see me, but as this process goes I start to wonder. What else goes with the rumour? Itâ€™s the first time really that Iâ€™ve ever wondered. Iâ€™m not going to go down the path, because I personally donâ€™t agree with the gossip gravy train, and I slap my own hands when I do it. But itâ€™s still a wonder. How many times have people talked about you?</p>
