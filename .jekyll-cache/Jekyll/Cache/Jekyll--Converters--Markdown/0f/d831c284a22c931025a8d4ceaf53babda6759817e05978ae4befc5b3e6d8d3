I"ê<p>A common phrase around here is â€œIâ€™m not saying, Iâ€™m just sayingâ€. Itâ€™s a moment of expressing yourself and itâ€™s not a moment where anyone needs to really care about what youâ€™re saying. There isnâ€™t even any point to whatâ€™s being said. They are sometimes just words spewing out of your mouth. Itâ€™s just a moment of steam release, kinda of link Mt. St. Helens. So, this entire post is just that. Iâ€™m not saying, Iâ€™m just saying.</p>

<p>With all the lead up youâ€™d probably expect something big, a big fuss and lots of edited @&amp;%$â€™n language. But youâ€™re not going to. Reason being, what is it that I have to say? I donâ€™t even know. Here I was thinking Iâ€™m this person with lotâ€™s of thoughts and ideas, yet when it comes down to it, Iâ€™m empty. It could be one of these down moments. You know, when youâ€™re looking around and re-evaluating, but it doesnâ€™t feel like that. Here I am bounding off into a brave new world, and Iâ€™m feeling empty. Not like empty as a gas tank, but empty in the brain. Iâ€™m working, or think Iâ€™m working but time goes by and nothing. Even my blogs. Where is all of this time I wanted to open up go?</p>

<p>Now, for those who know me, time management has never really been a strong suit of mine, matter of fact any type of organization hasnâ€™t been even remotely close to a skill I have in my bag-o-tricks. Iâ€™m one of these big idea, scatter everything to the wind kind of guys. Soâ€¦needless to say, Iâ€™ve got some learning to do.</p>
