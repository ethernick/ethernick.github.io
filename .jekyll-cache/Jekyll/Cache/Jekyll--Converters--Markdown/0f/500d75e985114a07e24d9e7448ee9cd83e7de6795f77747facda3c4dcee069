I"`<p>My head is all jumbled. Conflcts of priorities. My therapists has a wonderful word for this: <strong>Confuckeded</strong>.</p>

<p>And when I am, I do something to break the pattern. To make a small step towards something. This post - considering 
I haven’t posted in more than 9 months is just that small step.</p>

<p>What’s my next step?</p>
