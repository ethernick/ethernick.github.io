I"¼<p>Iâ€™ve got a little idea stirring in my head.</p>

<p>If I could open a store, I think it would be a beer store. And like wine, it would
have beer organized from region. And the first I would make sure is to have all
of Canada.</p>

<p>I would have no idea where to begin to do this, but it would be nice.</p>

<p>But to start with - Iâ€™m at least going to start sharing what I have tried.</p>
