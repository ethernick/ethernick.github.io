I"$<p>Last night was the first public gig for the <em>Blue Morris 6</em>! If I do say so myself, we kicked! Half way 
through I was in a little pain ( long story involving canada day celebration, beer and a big step…) but I stood like a flamingo on one leg and played away.</p>

<p>There were a few small flubs, but that’s the beauty of swing, no one noticed. If if they did, they didn’t 
care because they were dancing away. It was great to see people swing dancing in a little cafe. Can’t wait 
for the next gig. I’ll keep you posted.</p>
