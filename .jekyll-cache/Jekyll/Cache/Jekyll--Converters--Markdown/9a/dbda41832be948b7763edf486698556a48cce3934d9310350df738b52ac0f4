I"g<p>I’ve been looking at the word focus….</p>

<ul>
  <li>Close or narrow attention; concentration</li>
  <li>To concentrate attention or energy</li>
  <li>direct one’s attention on something</li>
</ul>

<p>And I’m reminded of a quote from The Princess Bride:</p>

<p>“You use that word a lot. I do not think it means what you think it means”</p>
