I"ô<p>I had intended on writing maybe a witty, and maybe and interesting post today. I wasnâ€™t exactly sure as to what or how or why. No topic had come to mind. I woke up, relaxed and made my morning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postum">Postum</a>. As I sat on my couch and started to drink I realized by butt was wet. Matter of fact, there was an odd smell. Oh crap! My cat had pissed on my couch yet again! I have been trying to figure out why he was doing it. I thought I was on the verge of figuring it out. Itâ€™s not his food, itâ€™s not his water, itâ€™s not his litter, itâ€™s not the living room. Itâ€™s not anything! Oh, and Iâ€™ve tried everything to clean the stuff up with. Iâ€™ve tried all sorts of brands. Cleansers with chemical, enzymatic cleaners, natural cleaners. I still havenâ€™t found anything. I found a reference somewhere to a new product which has a remote possibility to maybe get rid of the hidden smells we humans canâ€™t pick up on. So with that minor chance of a whim, Iâ€™ve just had to order online. Iâ€™m starting to go mad. My friend vanessa sayâ€™s to get rid of the couchâ€¦i just spent $600 on the couch a couple of years ago. Iâ€™m not throwing it out. I tried to look how much it would cost for new cushions. Guess â€¦ no just guess. $80 each. That $160, I donâ€™t have that money. Especially when Iâ€™ve quit my job to start this enterprise of my own.</p>

<p>Funny thing, is that just yesterday I was having a talk with my Dad about this my new lessons about the <a href="/chaso-equals-creativity">chaos theory</a>. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that everything, regardless of whether I know it or not has a root cause. My Dad on the other hand believes that some things donâ€™t have any reason. They just happen. So we debated on this for a little bit. In my new idea, to really fix a problem you need to know the root cause. If not, then you are just masking the problem. But what about moments like this where nothing is evident. You canâ€™t figure out the root problem. Do you give up on trying to figure what the root is? We donâ€™t always have the time to find the root cause. But I guess figuring out our own answers is part of the process. How we handle and learn from the unexpected is how we can define our success or failure.</p>
