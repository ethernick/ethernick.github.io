I"–<p>O.k. O.k. As some of my friends have pointed out to me, what good is a blog if you donâ€™t use it. Itâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve posted anything here. I kind of put little blinders on and focused completely on working and nothing about actually letting people know whatâ€™s going on. Half the fun about blogging is letting people know whatâ€™s going on and the discussions. So, when I found out how nice WordPress was, I thought, perfect! So here we go.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been talking about when I should have something up and running for people to see and play with. But I keep coming back and saying to myself itâ€™s not ready. And at the same time, Iâ€™m looking around and everyone has there site in beta, which was a plan that Iâ€™ve been thinking of doing. But Iâ€™ve dropped that idea from my radar. Iâ€™m either going to have a site or not. Iâ€™m either going to show people what Iâ€™m doing or not. I came across a nice quote which was a great kick in the butt.</p>

<p><strong>You canâ€™t build a reputation on what you are going to do.</strong></p>

<p>So, Iâ€™m going to change that. And Iâ€™m going to prove myself that Iâ€™m actually going forward.</p>
