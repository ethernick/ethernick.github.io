I"Ü<p>Site update of: http://www.vamcdonald.com</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been working on my friend Vanessaâ€™s site for some times. For the original site I think we collaborated quite well to give a gallery feel. However that was some time ago. As a bit of an internet enthusiast, I felt the pressure to update her site with the times. Iâ€™ve learned a lot since the original site, and every time I clicked â€œview sourceâ€ i could see all of those learning. So update it was.</p>

<h3 id="hanging-the-art">Hanging The Art</h3>
<p>I know the code isnâ€™t perfect, but Iâ€™ve made it so that adding and removing pieces from the website has the feeling of hanging real art. There is the step back to wonder if itâ€™s aligned in proportion to the piece next to it. There is the hand sign of moving the image up or down â€œjust a shimmyâ€. If the site was to be a gallery, then hanging should be no different.</p>

<h3 id="web-20">Web 2.0</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m not a fan of catch phrases. Especially when it comes to fad phrases like â€œWeb 2.0â€³. Itâ€™s essentially the same stuff thatâ€™s been around for a while, except a few javascript libraries, some faded backgrounds and large fonts have all spun together. Someone I guess just needed to find one phrase to encompass it all. Well, which some AJAX, some XHTML, CSS and even some bulky fonts here and there with a dash of gradient, Iâ€™ve tried to keep up.</p>

<h3 id="realign-vs-redesign">Realign vs Redesign</h3>
<p>I wanted to take a page out of Carmon Mollâ€™s article about <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/redesignrealign">Redesign vs Realign</a>. I wouldnâ€™t call myself a great designer by far. But if I could follow a couple of guidelines, I could be not half bad.</p>

<h3 id="all-in-all">All in All</h3>
<p>It was a pretty good venture to try and keep up to par with the virtual world. Lots of cursing because of IE. Lots of problem solving, and a bit of craziness. But all in all, itâ€™s out in the world to view. Take a look, feedback is always welcome.</p>
