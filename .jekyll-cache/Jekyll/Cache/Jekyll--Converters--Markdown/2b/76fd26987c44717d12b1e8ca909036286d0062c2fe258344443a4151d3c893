I"_<p>Came across <a href="http://www.broom.org/epic/">this</a> on Alan Meckler’s Blog. It’s an interesting theory of the future and what could happen. It’s got a pretty freaky undertone, especially when Seth posted <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/the_end_of_cand.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>Sure makes me wonder about the integrity and truth behind the future of all information, not just blogging. What year is this…1984?</p>

<p>[Update: Guess I should be paying more attention. There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060210032452/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/webcred/">Blogging, Journalism &amp; Credibility Conference</a> going on. Nice.]</p>
