I"b<p>Back in my post <a href="/crying-with-purpose">Crying With Purpose</a> I found that with the exercise <a href="https://www.stevepavlina.com/">Steve</a> had
discussed, the message of purpose that got to me was:</p>

<p><strong>To be at home with my head in the clouds and music in my heart.</strong></p>

<p>But after almost a month of thought, I’m stuck with one simple question. What
the @$#! does that mean? I mean, why couldn’t I have shed some tears over
something that made more sense! I’m sure with some more work I can translate this
into something, but for now I’m completely at a loss.</p>
