I"d<p>There are good lawyers &amp; bad lawyers. But we still know they follow the law. The power is in the
institutions and systems that make them.</p>

<p>Journalists should be the same. The more I think about this, the more I like it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lawyers have a “bar” organization that oversee’s the overarching ethics of behaviour</li>
  <li>Judges are external arbiters. Should an editor be the same?</li>
  <li>There is an open system of archives.</li>
  <li>Lawyers need to pass additional standards</li>
  <li>Not being a lawyer doesn’t preclude you from participating, but you’re still not a “lawyer”</li>
  <li>Law firms are legally set up in a specific way and can’t be set up otherwise</li>
  <li>Lawyers buy into ownership/partnership, and therefore have several fiduciary duties to balance</li>
</ul>

<p>Have any more points to add?</p>
