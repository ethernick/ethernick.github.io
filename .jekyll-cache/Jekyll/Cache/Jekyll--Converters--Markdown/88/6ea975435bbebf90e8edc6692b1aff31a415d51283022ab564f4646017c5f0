I"â<p>Yes, Iâ€™m one of the billions hooked on Harry Potter. And unlike those pretentious people who buy the â€œadultâ€ 
cover books, Iâ€™m not afraid to admit it. When I first saw the photographic like covers on the shelves I was 
slightly disturbed. Isnâ€™t there a phraseâ€¦hmmâ€¦let me think. Itâ€™s something about judgingâ€¦and covers. I think 
this is very appropriate because it also has something to do with books. Now what was that phrase? Oh anyway, 
Iâ€™m once again delving my attention into J.K. Rowlingsâ€™ world.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s funny really. I seem to have a very select handful of topics that I can actually read through without 
falling asleep: quantum physics, leadership and harry potter. Yeahâ€¦it baffles me too.</p>
