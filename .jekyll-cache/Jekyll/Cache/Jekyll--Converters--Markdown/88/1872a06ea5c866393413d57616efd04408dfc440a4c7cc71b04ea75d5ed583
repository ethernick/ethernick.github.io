I"ø<p>O.K. So Iâ€™ve taken a bit and Iâ€™ve pretty much started from scratch. Iâ€™ve decided to build it againâ€¦but, give me 10 dayâ€™s and I make good progress. The code behind the scenes is a little cleaner. Iâ€™ve still got lotâ€™s to go, but at this rate, I should hopefully have something to actually be proud of by the end of this month. Who knew a little financial pressure would be such a good motivatorâ€¦..</p>

<p>Now, that all of that is said, i need some feedback. so if you could please answer this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which template do you like?</li>
  <li>Does it make more sense to go right into the results rather then that first page?</li>
  <li>Is it faster?</li>
  <li>Could you navigate well?</li>
  <li>Does the navigation even make sense?</li>
  <li>Does the jump to form work?</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve got loads more questions but these are just a few I could think of. Again, please feel free to post you feedback in the comments.</p>
