I"þ<p>As time progresses, I add in new tools. Lately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060807235633/http://del.icio.us/nkempinski">del.icio.us</a> has become the keeper of my bookmarks and <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/nkempinski">last.fm</a> the keeper of my music. I didnâ€™t want to bog my own blog down with too many sources, but I figured some people might like to see all of this in one quick snapshot. Soâ€¦bring in a new tool: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060807235633/http://www.squidoo.com/tumbleweed/">Squidoo</a>. My topic, simply me.</p>

<p>Right now Iâ€™m not that interestingâ€¦according to the stats, Iâ€™m ranked <s>11,706</s> 3,442 (update: since I posted this Iâ€™ve shot up tremendously in rank. Yeah!) . So I encourage visitors. I donâ€™t care to be 1 but maybe a 3 digit ranking like 400ish, would be nice. Want to get a snapshot of me?
