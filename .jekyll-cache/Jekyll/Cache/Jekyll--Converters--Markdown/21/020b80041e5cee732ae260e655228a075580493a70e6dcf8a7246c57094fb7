I"ê<p>No, unlike the title, this has nothing to do with those things that the gymnasts are using, although the connection is a good coincidence ( Go Canada! Well that my little shout of patronage). What I refer to is the women and men behind the music streaming. These streamers in my opinion are another crew at the forefront. They arenâ€™t spouting off words like bloggers. They arenâ€™t pushing boundaries with ideas that are verbal. Their word is not a word at all. I took a small hiatus from listening, but Iâ€™m back and Iâ€™m back 10 fold. My entire day is listening to sweet beats from <a href="http://somafm.com">SomaFM</a> or <a href="http://dublab.com/">dublab</a>. Itâ€™s going to places like <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/">ShoutCast</a> and finding all the wonderful and obscure sounds from around the world.</p>

<p>They help me. Their music inspires me, which inspires my work, which hopefully gets me closer to innovation. Iâ€™m not their yet, but Iâ€™m hoping to be. I can go from thick phat beats, micro-beats, ambient, to indy rock, and foreign sounds; to the sitar and tabla. Itâ€™s about finding your sound. I find Iâ€™ve got the right stream for the right mood, and they now that Iâ€™ve found a few, they always hit the feeling on the button. Even if I donâ€™t feel it, just listening to the right one will change me.</p>

<p>I came across another blog with the same question Iâ€™m about to ask. (sorry if I could find the reference I would put it down). What streams do you listen to?</p>
