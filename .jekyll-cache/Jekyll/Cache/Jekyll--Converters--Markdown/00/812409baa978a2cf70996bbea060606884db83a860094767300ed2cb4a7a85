I"C<p>Read an interesting post on Curt Rosengren’s blog about the need to play: <a href="http://curtrosengren.typepad.com/occupationaladventure/2005/01/play_your_way_t.html">Play your way to your best work.</a></p>

<p>The idea that “work is called work for a reason” and that “work isn’t meant to be fun” is so deeply entrenched in our collective cultural psyche that it actually ends up being a big roadblock for many when they look at pursuing their passions.</p>

<p>It is also, of course, complete nonsense. The only thing that committing to a life of work as a four letter word will do will be to slowly, bit by bit, drain away both your energy and your productivity. A career filled with fun and meaning, on the other hand, can unleash the amazing potential we all have.</p>

<p>I’ve been going through this little energy drain myself. It started to come out in my <a href="/tricking-the-mind">previous post</a>. Nothing blatant but when you’re having fun, why do you need a trick at all? You see, here I am trying to find ways to “work” when in fact, maybe, I should be finding ways to “play”.</p>

<p>So, thanks Curt for not only giving me a little reminder of things lost, but also introducing me to <a href="https://www.deepfun.com/">Bernie DeKoven</a>. I think I’m going to take his site for a quick stroll.</p>
