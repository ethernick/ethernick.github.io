I"Õ<p>I am hooked on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8694364/">Years and Years</a>. If youâ€™re a 
Black Mirror fan, and havenâ€™t already started watching, this should be your next show.</p>

<p>Spoilers.</p>

<p>Small spoilers.</p>

<p>Teeny tiny spoilers.</p>

<p>The show follows a family over 15 years into the future. Nuff said about that.</p>

<p>A man meets a woman. They ask what each other does for a living. She is a Storyteller.</p>

<p>A Storyteller.</p>

<p>A storyteller as in sitting in a crowd using words. Ever one of those syllables taken 
in by those around.</p>

<p>A storyteller as in myths, and fables. Lessons woven in metaphors.</p>

<p>Even the writers of a TV show, are feeling it. Orality.</p>
