I"'<p><a href="https://www.stevepavlina.com/">Steve Pavlina</a> is easily running up the list in my favourite blogs. Why? Because
with an easy (and yet not easy at all) technique he helped me find <a href="https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/01/how-to-discover-your-life-purpose-in-about-20-minutes/">my life’s
purpose in about 40 minutes</a>.
Sure, his title says 20 minutes, but you’ve got to have all your personal baggage
in check if you want to reach that kind of speed. And sure enough, as the warning
went, when I was done I was bawling my eye’s out. Ya, I’m man enough to admit
that I was bawling like a kid who lost their first pet. It wasn’t pretty. Even
copying and pasting this little phrase brings a little tear to my eye, which means
I was successful.</p>

<p><strong>To be at home with my head in the clouds and music in my heart</strong></p>

<p>“Discovering your purpose is the easy part. The hard part is keeping it with you on a daily basis and working on yourself to the point where you become that purpose.”</p>

<p>Oh boy!</p>
