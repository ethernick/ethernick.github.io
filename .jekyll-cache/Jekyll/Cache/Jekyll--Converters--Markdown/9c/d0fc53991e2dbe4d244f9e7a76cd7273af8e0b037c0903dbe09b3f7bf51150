I"<p>Last night our band played a gig at trees cafe. Normally I wouldnâ€™t toot my own horn ( no, considering I play 
a sax, there was no initial intent for humour, however, the more I make a side comment on the fact that there 
is no humour, the more humour being to emergeâ€¦funny ), however, I was on fire! And I have to give credit 
where credit was due, my shoes.</p>

<p>I had a previous gig, however I was wearing my â€œfancyâ€ shoes. The gummy sole stuck to the floor and they sure 
as hell were uncomfortable. I decided for this gig to screw the foot attire for a nice old pair of shredded 
up airwalks. When the song started I realized that my feet we slipping on the floor and I was able to slide 
them all around. I was moving and swaying and it went from there. So I say thank you old pair of shoesâ€¦thank 
you.</p>

<p>What to hear a sample of me? Iâ€™m the low sax in this chart called Deed I do, or maybe something a little more 
slow like Georgia On My Mind. Staring: Aaron â€œBlueâ€ Morris â€“ guitar, Carly Jepsen â€“ vocals, Greg Lui â€“ tenor 
sax, Nick Kempinski (â€meâ€) â€“ baritone sax, Georgia Korba - bass, Soegi Hartono â€“ drums.</p>
