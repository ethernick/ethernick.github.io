I"+<p>I’ve been quiet, Mainly because I’ve been in TO working crazy hours in a room they call the “War Room”. With that name, you know it’s going to be crazy. However, A long flight, and I’m back home in Vancouver.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’ve got reams of emails and voicemails waiting, and I’ll get to them, one by one. But in the meantime I’ll share a drunk time poem.</p>

<p>Words flow like Leffe<br />
Sweet with a cinnamon taste<br />
Hints of Valentines<br />
Blurred by consumption<br />
One line dulls the heart<br />
One more the mind<br />
Verse after verse the<br />
Words mix and blur<br />
Eventually <br />
Creating only your desires<br />
My Key and strokes are<br />
Not my own<br />
Until the day after<br />
A trail of garments<br />
And a naked stranger<br />
Under your arm.</p>
