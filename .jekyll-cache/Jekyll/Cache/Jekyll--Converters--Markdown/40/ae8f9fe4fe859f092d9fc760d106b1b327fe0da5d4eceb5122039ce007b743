I"µ<p>Iâ€™m trying to find wayâ€™s to compile the data better. Quite frankly there are a billion and 3 places to get it from. As I time myself, getting the data in, is a management nightmare. I was thinking I might want to create a specialized crawler for the purpose to look out for events. However, Iâ€™ve never build one, so I need to take a look and learn. Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s even the best way of going about it. Any ideas?</p>
