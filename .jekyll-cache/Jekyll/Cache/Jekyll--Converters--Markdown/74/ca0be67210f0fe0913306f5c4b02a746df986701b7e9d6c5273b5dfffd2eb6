I""<p>With the inclusion of pages in WordPress, there isn’t really a need for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060104223106/http://wiki.whoisnick.com/">wiki</a> anymore. So, on that note, I’m going to start transitioning the wiki into Wordpress pages. I think it will a) open up space on my server for other things and b) integrate all my content into one nice little platform. I’ll be setting up RewriteRules to accommodate the new paths for anyone with bookmarks, but if it doesn’t work, let me know and I’ll get it fixed.</p>
