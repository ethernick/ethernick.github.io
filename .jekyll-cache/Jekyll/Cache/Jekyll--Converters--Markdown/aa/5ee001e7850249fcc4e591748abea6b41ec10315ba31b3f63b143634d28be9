<p>Itâ€™s a great point about the necessity for down time. The necessity for a break.
When is too much? Iâ€™ve taken a look at the people around and itâ€™s not just the
nine-to-fivers ( or should I call the seven-to-whatever-ers) that do it. Iâ€™ve been
noticing the worst culprits are the entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs naturally are
doing things that inspire them, that get their juices going. Itâ€™s easy to forget
about time and to be working when itâ€™s something that lights a fire under you.
But I ask all of you self employed people out thereâ€¦When was the last time you
had a weekend? When was the last time you took a day off?. I know that all of you
would easily come back to me full of excuses as to why. Full of reasoning that
you canâ€™t afford not to. I say blah blah blah! If you keep it upâ€¦youâ€™ll burn
out, and then nothing will get done. Which is worse?</p>
