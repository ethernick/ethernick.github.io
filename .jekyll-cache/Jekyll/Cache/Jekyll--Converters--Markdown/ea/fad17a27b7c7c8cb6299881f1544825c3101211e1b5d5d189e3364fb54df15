I"Ì<p>Wake up caged amongst the lost<br />
Walking through their world<br />
Look at the posters pointing<br />
The way not traveled has<br />
been traveled too much<br />
This world rich with illusion<br />
You think youâ€™re found<br />
You think itâ€™s wise<br />
To walk amongst the found<br />
is not travelling at all<br />
On a pedestal looking up<br />
In your caged Freedom<br />
Iâ€™m alive and drenched in<br />
the lonely<br />
The Lonely we are</p>
