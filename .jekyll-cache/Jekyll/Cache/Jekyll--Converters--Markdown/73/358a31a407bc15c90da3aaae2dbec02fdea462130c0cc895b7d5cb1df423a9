I"–<p>O.k. So Iâ€™ve gone through the process of adding the links to my â€œNetworkingâ€ section, on the left side. Iâ€™ve signed up to 3 different sites and Iâ€™ve been playing with how they work and what can be done.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060127005544/http://www.ecademy.com:80/">Ecademy</a> - Seems to be chalker block full of features and additions. Youâ€™ve got blogs and message boards, meetings and clubs but only if you can afford it. Iâ€™m still looking through it, but so far, nothing for the broke ( which is me ).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> - Itâ€™s a friendster for business. You can search profiles, groups, experiences, business industries, anything that the users put up. And another bonus, itâ€™s free. Iâ€™m connected to 1 person so far, woohoo!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/">MeetUp</a> - This siteâ€™s purpose is a little different. Like LinkedIn, itâ€™s free. Theyâ€™ve got a small twist, its goal is to create physical networks. Sure theyâ€™ve got a message board but their strive is to make the face to face connections, which is scary but I think can be very beneficial. Iâ€™ve got my first meetup on Feb 10.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately like real networking, itâ€™s something that takes time an patience, so one week isnâ€™t going to get me huge results. Iâ€™ll check in from time to time to let you know how the network grows.</p>
