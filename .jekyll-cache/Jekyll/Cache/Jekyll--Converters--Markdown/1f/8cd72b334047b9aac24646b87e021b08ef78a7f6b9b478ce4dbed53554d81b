I"/<p>Sure, it took me long enough, and I’ve still got miles to go before I sleep. But I’ve got something up in a development location, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050907005611/http://dev.wherestheshow.com/">dev.wherestheshow.com</a>. Remember this is for development purposes so if something goes completely wrong, it’s to be expected. There is a whack of things still to do especially the reminders feature, which is a really key feature needed before launch.</p>

<p>Oh and one problem, was as I was building this out, the data I had in there is now outdated. So now I need to scramble to add in more listings into the system. If there are any listings you want to see, let me know.</p>

<p>So people, time to hack away. Let me know what sucks and what doesn’t. The more feedback the better.</p>
