I"”<p>It seems there was a mistake in a shipment of Doris Day DVDâ€™s. The BBC reported, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/4212207.stm">Sex movie mix-up shocks couple</a>.</p>

<p>Now hereâ€™s the kicker.</p>

<p>The couple, regular attendees at their local Baptist church, settled down with a cup of tea to watch the 1957 musicalâ€¦ â€œMy wife and I were very shocked but we watched it until the end because we couldnâ€™t believe what we were seeing.â€</p>

<p>When people are in shock theyâ€™ll watch just about anything! This was a mistake, but just turn the T.V. on and youâ€™ll see this kind of stuff happening intentionally.</p>
