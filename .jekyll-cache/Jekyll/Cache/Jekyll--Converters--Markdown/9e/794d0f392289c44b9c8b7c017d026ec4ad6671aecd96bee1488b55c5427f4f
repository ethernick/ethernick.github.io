I"À<p>Iâ€™m in the process of transitioning over to <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>. There are several reasons why:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Damn!</strong> - They have a great deal for the bandwidth, space and scripting possibilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Rudy on Rails</strong> - Iâ€™ve been eyeing it for some time, but if I donâ€™t have a host that allows it, whatâ€™s the point?</li>
  <li><strong>Attune to Customers Needs and Knowledge.</strong> - Now this is something unexpected. I originally signed up for the 1st 2 reasons. But as I was learning about how they do business I found they go to lengths to understand their customers expectations really well. Just look at these 2 options in their contact form they understand how to respond, when to respond, and maybeâ€¦just maybe they get the customer to chuckle:</li>
</ol>
