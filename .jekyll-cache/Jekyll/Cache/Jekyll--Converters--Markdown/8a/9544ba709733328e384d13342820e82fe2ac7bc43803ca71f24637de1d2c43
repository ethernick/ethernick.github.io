I"¢<p>Upgrade is complete. Itâ€™s taken a bit of tweaking, and playing but Iâ€™m now running <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/">WordPress 1.5</a>. I think the biggest hurtle was my customized layout. Sure, the new version of the template system, is much more convenient to switch but, a pain if you have youâ€™re own template. But, all in all, the features theyâ€™ve added are nice.</p>

<p>While I was at it, I made some other changes I wanted to as well. You might notice some changes, or you might not. Regardless, here is a run down of what might be different</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> this is my biggest peeve, but, itâ€™s personal. I like Sunday - Saturday calendars. Well, this one isnâ€™t. They say it has something to do with mySQL. Iâ€™m looking into that so I can get it back the way I want it.</li>
  <li><strong>Sidebar:</strong> the sidebar has a different order.</li>
  <li><strong>Single View:</strong> the new template system allows me to have different layouts for a single post view. So Iâ€™ve used it.</li>
  <li><strong>Feeds:</strong> this was for fun. Iâ€™ve fixed the â€œmoreâ€ and the â€œnext pageâ€ in the feeds. Iâ€™ve also added in category links.</li>
</ul>

<p>So thatâ€™s pretty much it. Iâ€™ve still got some minor things, like I just found out it doesnâ€™t validate to XHTML, so Iâ€™m going to be working on that over the next little bit. But all in all, pretty good.</p>
