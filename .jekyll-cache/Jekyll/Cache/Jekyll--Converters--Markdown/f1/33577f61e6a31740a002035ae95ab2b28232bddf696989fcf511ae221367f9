I"û<p>Today was a big day for me. I found out that I was a ritalin kid ( I guess this ties into my recent post declaring myself as a generalist). I knew that I was hyperactive but the thought of actually being <em>diagnosed</em>, that adds an interesting realm to the whole thing. Now a days the definition has changed to ADHD, but itâ€™s all the same.</p>

<p>This is having a funny impact, one that I didnâ€™t expect. Itâ€™s the idea of a label. What I have, the problems Iâ€™ve faced my entire life now has a label. That seems to have a profound relation to how you handle it. What once I thought was unique about me, by definition, is now considered a disorder - something unwanted, something to remove. I was fighting my own mind. Half of me was agreeing with the term but the other half was yelling, â€œdonâ€™t get rid of itâ€. Today I found myself driving around town trying to deal with this new found memory. My thoughts drifting as I like to let them; flashes of me wondering. What would it be like to focus for longer then 20 minutes on something? How much more could I accomplish without this? I could actually finish something for once in my life. I found that I was starting to bucket my memories and put â€œblameâ€ for things. Oh, I did that because I was ADHD. A â€œregularâ€ person wouldnâ€™t have done thatâ€¦it must have been because the ADHD.</p>

<p>But I donâ€™t like labels. And this is a prime example for it. It makes excuses. â€œOh I canâ€™t finish __ because Iâ€™m ADHDâ€. Thatâ€™s a bunch of crap! I shook my head around a little and the other half kicks in and reminds me, what would my life have been without it? I wouldnâ€™t be me, thatâ€™s for sure. And then I started to think about it more. You know, Itâ€™s something that allows me to adapt quicker then others. Because of it, Iâ€™m hard wired to deal with several things at once. Iâ€™m designed to multi-task. I can use my whirlwind mind can create patterns in a moment where others need time. I can split out possibility after possibility without a second thought. All I need to do is allow my mind to ramble. My disorder is not a disorder at all but a blessing. It makes me, me.</p>

<p>And so, at the end of the day, I wonder, How big was it? Oh it was a big day, but will I change because of it? No way!</p>
