I""<p>Interesting…I’m not a full scientist and even the dumbed down version is a little complex to understand but essentially people could be addicted to decisions. Take a look at this post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041024013719/http://www.corante.com:80/brainwaves/archives/004800.html">on Corante</a>.</p>

<p><strong>“Contrary to the intuitive sense that we passively receive signals from the outside world and that our experience reflects this input, evidence is growing that sensations are usually preceded by a decision process.”</strong></p>

<p>The article goes on to say that our systems will actually inject us with endogenous opioid peptides (??) which actually can act as pain suppressors, after a decision is made. And like the real thing, pain killers are addictive. This could definitely explain the term power hungry, it’s not that they are hungry for the power, they are merely addicted to the decisions, and the large rewards, that people of power make.</p>

<p>“Hi, I’m Nick and I’m addicted to decisions.”</p>
