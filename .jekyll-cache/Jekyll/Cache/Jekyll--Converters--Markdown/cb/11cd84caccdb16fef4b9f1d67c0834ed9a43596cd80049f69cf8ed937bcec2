I"„<p>Itâ€™s time I started from scratch again. As any of you who have been coming back to my site praying and hoping for any at all some sort of update, you havenâ€™t been getting one. Why? I donâ€™t have a good explanation. Itâ€™s just laziness. Well ladies and gentleman, <strong>change is in the air!</strong> Iâ€™ve formally put in notice with my job, and in about a little more than 2 months down the road, I will be officially an entrepreneur. I will be working for myself. All this has accumulated from gut feelings of despair and monotony. Iâ€™ve been educating myself, reading various blogs and becoming a little bit of a sponge for leadership and a bit on design. As a result, Iâ€™ll be trying to post more interesting articles.</p>

<h3 id="new-look">New Look</h3>
<p>Off the bat as you can see, Iâ€™ve changed the look. Itâ€™s the same but different. Itâ€™s been XHTML-ified, revamped using a nifty thing we like to call web standards. Itâ€™s not perfect and sure, people will always have something to say, but itâ€™s the effort of evolution that counts. Along with the snazzy new colours Iâ€™m going to try and do a but of colour coding on these posts. If itâ€™s a post about business, or pleasure, philosophy, or music, you should so see a difference in the post off the bat. I thought about adding more, but, half the appeal about the new look is simplify.</p>

<h3 id="new-thoughts">New Thoughts</h3>
<p>Well with all of this change Iâ€™m sure a question is what will you be expecting with this new leaf? Whatâ€™s different? Whatâ€™s changed? Youâ€™ll be reading more opinionated and sharing types of post. It seems that Iâ€™ve got thoughts and ideas that Iâ€™ve been keeping stored in my brain. Iâ€™ve been afraid to share but I need to put myself out there with some opinions, some thoughts and some theories. If I donâ€™t then no one will benefit, no one will improve and ultimately, I wonâ€™t improve.</p>
