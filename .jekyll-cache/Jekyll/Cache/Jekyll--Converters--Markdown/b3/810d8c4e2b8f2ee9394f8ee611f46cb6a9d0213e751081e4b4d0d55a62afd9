I"Ù<p>The warthogs? No. I started a small group class about tapping into our creativity and about creative writing. 
Itâ€™s held by a wonderful woman ( of which I probably will be referencing her as time goes by ) named Dari. 
With each class she has them come up with a name for themselves. With a little work and thought, we are 
<strong>The Chrysalis</strong>. Considering the <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/chrysalis">definition</a> I would say itâ€™s 
a very fitting name.</p>

<p><small><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa#Chrysalis">wikipedia</a></strong> has pretty much the same definition, but 
I thought I would connect to itâ€¦itâ€™s looking a little barren. Know something? Share</small></p>
