I"à<p>I guess Iâ€™ve had enough time to follow the dreams, and now itâ€™s time to set them aside and focus on getting a job. I was hoping to have my dream website done so that I could make â€œbillionsâ€ of dollars. But I guess that Iâ€™m just going to have to wait on that. The dream isnâ€™t dead, but itâ€™s just not going to be moving along as quickly as it could. Resumes are flying out the door today. Temp services have been called and Iâ€™m now active, waiting for someone in the work world not to come in today, or call in sick for tomorrow from some reason or another. Iâ€™m following the smell of jobâ€™s around the town. Iâ€™m following the trail that leads me to money, for I have none.</p>

<p>A part of me feels that this past six months have been a complete failure. Iâ€™m wondering why couldnâ€™t I do it. Whatâ€™s wrong with me? Iâ€™m stupid for thinking that I could accomplish such a task. Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s rocket science. In my eyes it was a simple site. A simple website. It shouldnâ€™t have been that challenging. And in a way it probably wasnâ€™t. In a way, maybe I have. But in so many more ways, I havenâ€™t. In the past six months Iâ€™ve learned so much. Iâ€™ve gained so many new perspectives. Iâ€™ve tried new things, looked at things differently. Iâ€™ve learned a lot about who I am, and what makes me tick. Iâ€™ve asked myself some serious questions ( not like I got all the answers but at least the question was asked ). Iâ€™ve grown. And that, in my opinion, out ways this â€œfailureâ€. So in the grand scheme of things Iâ€™ve succeeded because 1) Iâ€™m not done. Iâ€™m going to keep this going. Sure itâ€™s going to take more time, but Iâ€™m still moving forward with it. and 2) I have no regrets. I learned something about me from this whole venture. And learning something about yourself is something that you will keep the rest of your life.</p>

<p>So, off to the pavement, with resumes, a smile and a hand shake ready. Iâ€™m off to get me a job. I need to work to live.</p>
