I"¦<p>Iâ€™ve just come out of a month of frustration, and I recently came to a conclusion</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to be combining an idea from Tom Peterâ€™s called Wow, along with another simple philosophy called K.I.S.S.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IF NO â€œWOW,â€ NO GO!
Does â€œitâ€ Pop?
Does â€œitâ€ Sparkle?
Does â€œitâ€ make you Grin?
Is â€œitâ€ â€¦ WOW?
If â€œitâ€ (grand or mundane) isnÊ¼t WOW â€¦ re-do it! Or donÊ¼t do it!
This is â€¦ Your Day.
Not â€œtheirâ€ day.
This Day belongs â€¦ ULTIMATELY â€¦ to You.
Not â€œthem.â€
Cubicle slaves Unite!
Technicolor Titans rejoice!
Throw off the shackles of Conformity!
Just say/shout a throaty â€œNo!â€ to Non-WOW!
So â€¦
WOW!
Now!
(No bull. This is do-able.)</p>

  <p>K.I.S.S.
Keep
It
Simple
Stupid!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™ve been finding that as time is going by Iâ€™m making this whole things way too complicated. And Iâ€™ve looked at it and thought, well, this is o.k. But not wow! and really that not fair to anyone now is it.</p>

<p>I know the logo will be the same, after all, I just got business cards. I know that some of the layout elements will look the same, but Iâ€™m building it again from scratch. Iâ€™m pretty much throwing all the other stuff away. Itâ€™s not modular enough; itâ€™s not expandable enough, itâ€™s definitely not clean enough, and quite frankly, the code is complete crap. Letâ€™s face it, I can get by with perl, but Iâ€™m no expert. So, Iâ€™m going to dumb the language down a little ( some would argue ) to php. Itâ€™s a little more like my realm.</p>

<p>Sure, itâ€™s a stupid thing for me to do, but as I said on my own blog, Iâ€™ve got the rest of my life left, I can afford to be stupid once in a while.</p>
