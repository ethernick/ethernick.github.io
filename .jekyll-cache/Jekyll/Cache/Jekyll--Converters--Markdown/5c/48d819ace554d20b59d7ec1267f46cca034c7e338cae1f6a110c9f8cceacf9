I"ÿ<p>The festivus and gatherings are quiet. Iâ€™ve somehow ended up in the office working away through the candy hangover. Why Iâ€™m supposed to be in the office for the next three days is a mystery however, the lack of people make it for nice catch-up time. Iâ€™m able to do all the dreaded paperwork and documentation and as an added bonus, Iâ€™ve been able to sneak in an upgrade of my site from Wordpress 1.5 to the new and flashy 2.0, yeah!</p>

<p>And now back to our quieter then normal programmingâ€¦</p>
