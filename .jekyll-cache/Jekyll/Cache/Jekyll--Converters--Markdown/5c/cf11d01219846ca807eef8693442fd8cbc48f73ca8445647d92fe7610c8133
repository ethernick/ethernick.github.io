I"ı<p>Iâ€™ve seen a couple of instalments of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/">The Hour</a> and so far itâ€™s a refreshing take to news. Previously, I stopped watching news or caring about news because quite frankly it sucks. All of it, the news; the people. Well, welcome George Stroumboulopoulos and welcome back caring about news! I love this new take. Congrats not just to George, but to the CBC for allowing this on the air. He started his interview â€œHey Man, whatâ€™s happeningâ€. Who does that?</p>
