I"ğ<p>I did it again! I missed the first day of Spring last year, and I missed it again! For others it might not be a big deal, however Spring Solstice is one of the most important celebrations. Why? New beginnings; rebirth. There is a reason why itâ€™s called â€œspring cleaningâ€. Itâ€™s the real New Year. Nature wakes up again; refreshed. As a tradition for the spring I read over the story of <strong><a href="/jumping-mouse">Jumping Mouse</a></strong>. So many lessons so many analogies.</p>
