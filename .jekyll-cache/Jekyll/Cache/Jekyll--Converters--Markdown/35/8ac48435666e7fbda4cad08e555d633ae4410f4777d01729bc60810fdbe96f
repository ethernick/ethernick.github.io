I"á<p>Iâ€™ve added a link to my friends in the sidebar: Robots Hate Cancer. Reason being my friend Daniel, has a good 
friend of his going through this battle against cancer. And the site has been set up for 2 things. 1 - Itâ€™s a 
great way to get out there the perspective of our generation the (20s-30s) going through this ordeal. 2 - It 
ainâ€™t cheap, so they are using it as a platform to raise money.</p>

<p>In our brief conversation earlier today, an interesting thought came up on the necessary mind set that is 
needed. Itâ€™s the survival, the necessity to fight. as they are saying in the site, â€œwe can do more than wear 
our stylish bracelets.â€ Just looking at the site shows this. Itâ€™s more like !#$&amp; YOU CANCER! And I think 
thatâ€™s the best and most powerful mindset to have. So I post this article not out of â€œpoor poorâ€ person with 
cancer, but more like FNA! Letâ€™s all give cancer the finger while we burn it to hell with lasers shooting 
from our eyes.</p>
