I"Û<p>You know that sound your mother used to make as she waved her finger back and forth â€œTisk, Tiskâ€. Well my metaphoric mother is doing that to me right now. Here I am, trying to share information and itâ€™s been too long scion Iâ€™ve posted. I guess you could say I fell off the wagon, but did I really. I might not have posted it, but since my last post I had the pleasure of reading â€œValues Shiftâ€ by John B. Izzo and Pam Withers. It was on or local chapters Company of Friends, and like always I didnâ€™t really notice it until afterwards. And I thought heyâ€¦why not. WOW! I donâ€™t normally do the all caps thing but WOW!</p>

<p>Here I was thinking that me going off to start my own business and make a difference in the world was a minority, but as Iâ€™m reading, Iâ€™m seeing so much in me in this book. As a man who cradles both generation X and Y ( X ending 1977 and Y starting 1978, with me December 77 ) Iâ€™m finding that my values arenâ€™t of my parents and itâ€™s because of them that itâ€™s not. Seeing what they went through for me, deciding â€œnoâ€ thatâ€™s not going to be me.</p>

<p>The sad thing, is how many companies will actually take the serious call of the boomers leaving. Itâ€™s like the changing of the guards on a mass scale, but what if there is no guard behind you? I find Iâ€™m asking myself some serious questions and wondering, Whatâ€™s the world going to look like when Generation X is those fat catâ€™s pulling the strings, how bout Generation Y?</p>
