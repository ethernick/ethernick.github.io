I"¯<p>Testing a <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">netlify cms</a> post. Thereâ€™s a few things Iâ€™m still wrapping my head around. But interesting so far.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> Well that was interesting. Did some strange post not found. But after refresh worked. Does it always do that?</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 2020-09-08:</em></strong> Never used Netlify for this, so not as interesting as I thought.</p>
