I"P<p>I’m going through some of my chicken scratch that I’ve collected in my book of scribbles and came across some poetry. No relevance to anything really, I just liked it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Kateri wraps in tight<br />
Holds with might<br />
She’s just fine don’t<br />
mind the sight</p>

<p>Kateri’s got her quill<br />
it’s her thrill<br />
hematic pill<br />
grisly thrill</p>

<p>benevolent malignity<br />
persecuted generosity
masochistic clemency<br />
sentimental agony</p>

<p>Kateri’s got her quill<br />
it’s her thrill<br />
push in tight<br />
it has to be real</p>
