I"¸<p>Most of the Sci Fi I watch now, I thinkâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>â€œYa - I can see that happening.â€</strong></p>

<p><em>Black Mirror</em> has done too good of a job at laying out the plausible.</p>

<p>Even after watching Altered Carbon.</p>

<p>I still donâ€™t think most is that far fetched. And I think it should be.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seen glimpses that surprised me. Yet still - Iâ€™m thinking in my grand
childrenâ€™s time, maybe.</p>

<p>Maybe Iâ€™ve been watching too muchâ€¦</p>

<p>Maybe I canâ€™t <em>watch</em> the kind of Sci Fi that Iâ€™m looking for.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been sitting on the genre sidelines too long. Time to pick up some books.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll let you know how it goes.</p>
