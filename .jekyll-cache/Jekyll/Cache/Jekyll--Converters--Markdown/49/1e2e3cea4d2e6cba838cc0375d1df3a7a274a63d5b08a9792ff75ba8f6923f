I"<ul>
  <li>I do not choose to be common.</li>
  <li>It is my right to be uncommon â€“ if I can.</li>
  <li>I seek opportunity â€“ not security.</li>
  <li>I do not wish to be a kept citizen, humbled, and dulled by having the state look after me.</li>
  <li>I want to take a calculated risk, to dream and to build, to fail and to succeed.</li>
  <li>I refuse to barter incentive for a dole.</li>
  <li>I prefer the challenges of life to guaranteed existence; the thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of Utopia.</li>
  <li>I will not trade freedom for beneficence nor my dignity of the handout.</li>
  <li>I will never cower before any master nor bend to any threat.</li>
  <li>It is my heritage to stand erect, proud and unafraid, to think and act for myself, to enjoy the benefit of my creations and to face the world boldly and say:</li>
  <li>This, with Godâ€™s help, I have done.</li>
  <li>All this is what it means to be an Entrepreneur.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>Official credo of the American Entrepreneurs Association</small></p>
