I"¨<p>As Iâ€™ve been getting into the world of business, Iâ€™m still an infant in this world, Iâ€™ve been noticing a trend. It seems to me that people are afraid of the theological implications of business. Why is it that people are afraid of the spiritual in business? Iâ€™m willing to admit that my new eyes in this world are wrong. Iâ€™m willing to admit that Iâ€™m not reading the right places or seeing the right things, but if thatâ€™s the case, can someone please let me know.</p>

<p>With so many people around the world believing in something beyond, I find it strange that itâ€™s not as widely spoken about in business. Words like faith are intently avoided. I came across a <a href="http://curtrosengren.typepad.com/occupationaladventure/2004/07/breathe.html">post</a> that Curt Rosengren, The Occupational Adventurer(sm), made about meditation. I was happy for the fact that such a world like â€œmeditationâ€ and â€œcenteringâ€ made it into a blog about business; I was happy at the fact that he was making a good point about the importance to take a moment to calm. But he then decided to keep going with, â€œI donâ€™t mean wrap yourself in a pretzel and contemplate the sound of one hand clapping meditation.â€ Whatâ€™s that? Did that sound like a little slam? My point here isnâ€™t an attack on Curt, thank you by the way for triggering this little thought. My point is that if yoga or thai-chi or meditative chanting is a tool youâ€™ve found to use, then use it.</p>

<p>You canâ€™t be afraid to believe in your beliefs in this world. If you are where a suit and in an office you canâ€™t be expected to put your spirit away in a little box and hide it. Their is a warningâ€¦.<strong>you canâ€™t shove it in people faces either</strong>. If they donâ€™t believe in your belief so be it, move on. Iâ€™ve found the most interesting conversations and those most enlightening moments with co-workers are when I speak about the spiritual things.</p>
