I"\<p>I’ve always thought about media. Sometimes, maybe my thoughts are behind the times.
Other times, I’m wondering who else in this world is having similar thoughts.</p>

<p>Maybe
it’s all because I recently finished <em>Neil Postman’s</em>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6594462-amusing-ourselves-to-death">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>.
Maybe it’s because of the topsy turviness happening all around us. Maybe, I haven’t
found, yet, the one person who’s looking at, and talking about, media in the same
context.</p>

<p>Maybe if you know of someone you can let me know.</p>
