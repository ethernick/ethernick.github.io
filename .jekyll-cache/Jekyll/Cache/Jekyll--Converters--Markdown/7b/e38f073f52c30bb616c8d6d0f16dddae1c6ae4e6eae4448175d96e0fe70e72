I"ö<p>Well thanks to Curt Rosengren and Steve Pavlina, Iâ€™m going to take Curtâ€™s suggestion of play with Steveâ€™s reminder of values and goals to create a play date for finding and assessing my values. I have goals set, but no values to help them out. I think I have an idea of why Iâ€™m having troubles with this independent venture. As Steve said in his article <em>â€œIf you fail to focus your energy on the goals that are truly important to you, some of them will slip away, and thatâ€™s a heavy price to pay.â€</em> To make things a little harder what happens when the goals you have complete conflict with the values? Well thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m hoping to find out today. Iâ€™ll keep you posted on the outcome.</p>

<p>A quick thought, organizations should go through this same process. Most big organizations and corporations have a way of creating and reviewing goals, but what happens when those goals conflict with the organizational values of the corporate culture? Probably not a good thing either.</p>
