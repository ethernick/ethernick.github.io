<p>Once in a while when people ask me how things are going, I answer, “I’m fighting.” They often wonder what. I tell them it’s a battle. That I’m not exactly sure who the monster is or the demons in the war, but that regardless of my surrounding, it’s a battlefield.</p>

<p>I think this afternoon I got some insight into this battle, maybe even a weapon or two. I can now put some faces to my enemy, they all look like me. Steven Pressfield’s, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446691437/qid=1108679680/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-0820290-1630346?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">the War of Art</a>, is a blunt kick in the ass as to show who the real demons are. It’s a refreshing word as to the importance and necessity of persistence to our visions and our true selves.</p>

<p>It’s definitely got my brain turning and racing as I look around and see evidence of my losses. As I’m getting closer and closer to the real me, the Resistance ( yes, that’s a capital R) against me, is also increasing. I just need to keep in check with it. I need to look it in the face and keep paddling through it. I need to keep at it regardless of the surroundings. I need to do it, even if I was the last person on earth.</p>

<p>One of my personal battles is with scheduling, as you’ve seen in my <a href="/passion-killers">previous posts</a>. Yet there was a passage that got me thinking.</p>

<p>Someone once asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050323180306/http://www.answers.com:80/Somerset%20Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a> if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “I write only when inspiration strikes,” He replied. “Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>It makes me question. Maybe it wasn’t that my passion was being killed by the calendar, but as I got closer to what I <strong>needed</strong> to do, Resistance was fighting harder. I justified and rationalized this whole thing out of the picture. I looked again at the list of Needs, Talents, Passion and Purpose. And there it was, completely overlooked: Sharing, Creating Community.</p>

<p>I know I haven’t spelled out too much of what I’m trying to do in my posts, but essentially it’s an online event calendar. It’s <strong>sharing</strong> with others information about what’s going on. And in essence <strong>creating communities</strong>. So how is it that what I’m building isn’t in that?</p>

<p>Those damn sirens of the sea! Causing hallucinations and madness. And they would have gotten away with it if it were for that darn book!</p>
