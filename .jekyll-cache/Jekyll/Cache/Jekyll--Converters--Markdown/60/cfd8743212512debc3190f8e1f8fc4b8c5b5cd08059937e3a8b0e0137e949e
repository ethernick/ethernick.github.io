I"u<p>I don’t post enough poetry. Last night we had an exercise in class called, ode to spring, and here is the poem that came from it.</p>

<p>A landscape of white desert<br />
Nothing but howling of the wind<br />
being torn by sleeping claws of trees<br />
Each wooden stump a tombstone<br />
engraved “2005 A devoted Mother”<br />
But in this time of rest and death<br />
the sun conspires with<br />
the moon, the sky and stars<br />
And with wiccan like chants<br />
and native tribal dance<br />
they splatter the ground with <br />
a concoction of love<br />
so powerful to wake the infinite slumber<br />
And slowly from faded calling<br />
she claws through the soil<br />
With sweat and ache <br />
her joints pop and muscles shake<br />
Finally she peaks just one finger<br />
above the ground<br />
Above her white grave<br />
And on the fingers tip a bud of pink.</p>
