I"¹<p>Iâ€™m liking this whoe micro blog in github thing. Only thing is, when not at a fully prepped system, or on the road it would be nice to edit. So Iâ€™m on the hunt.</p>

<p>This particular little post is using <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>.</p>

<p>Not too shabby - I like the presuggested file with date. Would have liked prefilled metadata - or something to help suggest ( letâ€™s more honest - remember ) it.</p>

<p>ok. Hitting save - to see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong>:</p>

<p>The publish flag is a nice add on - but wasnâ€™t visibile enough so had to take a second. And titlesâ€¦ not 100% sold on how those are working. Wasnâ€™t as intuative. Still does the trick though.</p>

<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>

<p>So many updates before the blog is even published. You know that title thing that wasnâ€™t intuative - well it wasnâ€™t a title, it was a full filepath. soâ€¦ really not intuative. Meta Data it is.</p>
