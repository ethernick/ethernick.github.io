I"È<p>An interesting point crept up yesterday in The Chrysalis that I had never thought before. I had just finished 
reading my homework, and everyone was taken aback. At the time of reading it, I was moven to shake and even a 
tear or two crept out. I guess, I to, was taken aback by the piece. But, there kicker of it all is while I 
was writing it, it was just something I did. I did not emote the same reactions as reading it nor did it 
really feel all that challenging. It seemed ordinary.</p>

<p>It brought up an interesting point about our own personal reaction to ordinary. Ordinary are things that we 
know, and things we experience on a regular basis. So often we take things that align perfectly with who we 
are as ordinary. Itâ€™s like breathing and blinking, itâ€™s so fundamental to your existence that you might not 
even notice it.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone has something extraordinary in them, they just have to look for it. So often when I 
sit and look for mine, Iâ€™m thinking of things on the end of the spectrum, things that I donâ€™t know yet or 
things I want to know. Those are necessary things to look at, but one canâ€™t forget the in between; the 
ordinary. What are all the things you do in a day? What are the things that you do that come naturally? Maybe 
write an activity log for a few days and see what things are common, and seriously take a moment to look at 
them. Can any of these things be that passion, that extraordinary thing?</p>
