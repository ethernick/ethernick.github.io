I"ž<p>A quote come up from last nights creative class. I thought I would share</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am Protennoia the Thought that dwells in the Light 
She who exists before the All 
I move in every creature
I am the invisible One within the All
I am perseption and Knoledge, uttering a Voice by means of Thought
I am the real Voice.
Trimorphic Protennoia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Triple-formed Primal Thought)</p>
