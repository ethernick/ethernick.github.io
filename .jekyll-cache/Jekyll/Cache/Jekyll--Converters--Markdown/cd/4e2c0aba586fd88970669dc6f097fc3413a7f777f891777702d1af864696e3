  <p>“These sudden inspirations… never happen except after some day of voluntary effort which has appeared 
absolutely fruitless and whence nothing good seems to have come, where the way taken seems totally astray. 
These efforts then have not been as sterile as one thinks; they have set agoing the unconcious machine and 
without them it would not have moved and would have produced nothing.”</p>
