I"œ<p>For those of us locked into only 60 channels of T.V. ( remember when there were 3? ) and especially in the 
hick world of Canada, we are just starting to see the pleasures of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Dead Like 
Me</a>. I saw the pilot on 
Showcase the other day and then proceeded to rent most of the first season. There are several good things about the 
show:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Great concept</li>
  <li>good scripts</li>
  <li>All the streets are Vancouver</li>
</ol>

<p>Yup, good olde ( yes, with an e ) Vancouver. I was aware that Vancouver was becoming a nice little sci-fi 
drama capital in the Television industry but lately everywhere I look, It‚Äôs Vancouver. And, unlike the 
others, with this show, because it‚Äôs not supposed to be a planet far away, it makes the idea of Grim Reapers 
among us all the more captivating. I find myself immersed just that little extra to say‚Ä¶‚Äùthat guy died just 
outside my office‚Äù</p>
