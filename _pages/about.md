### Heck if I know…

But since you’re already curious, I’ve been working in web & communication circles for roughly 15 years. If you were to take the web out of the picture… all my life, including music, acting, and the likes. Yes – I was one of the school finalists for speeches.

I’m driven by curiosity. If I say “Huh, I wonder how that works?” Chances are I’ll find out in a day or two.

### But what’s this site about?

This is just fun. a collection of things I do, fun, giggle over, am moved by and otherwise inclined to share and post.
