<p>I want to sign up to one of the <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/List-of-Mastodon-instances.md">mastodon instances</a></p>
<p>I Just can't pick right now. It's like registering for [insert absurd name here]@hotmail.com.
  Or using hotmail or yahoo for an aplication to any tech job. I feel it will be important soon.</p>
<p>What's really good is that Mastodon is the layer missing from Twitter. If twitter is the hum
  and churn of a busy street. Mastodon are the shops and cafe's along the way. Pop in an out of
  mini communities all while being connected.</p>
<p>I'm surprised more businesses haven't spun any instances or communities up yet</p>
