Given that the past year has been a big one, it's time to see how my personality test holds up to [last years](/my-personality-2018).

### Your type is: INFP

"Questor". High capacity for caring. Emotional face to the world. High sense of honor derived from internal values. 4.4% of total population.

| type | score | type behavior motivation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 25 | I must be unique/different to survive. |
| 9 | 25 | I must maintain peace/calm to survive. |
| 7 | 20 | I must be fun and entertained to survive. |
| 3 | 19 | I must be impressive and attractive to survive. |
| 2 | 18 | I must be helpful and caring to survive. |

High level - still INFP. Lower level my type has shifted a tad. Probably as priorities and desires have changed with the little man.

If you're curious about yours, this was made using the [Jung+Enneagram](http://similarminds.com/embj.html) test.
