I’ve been holding off on this one, because of the problem with the “more” function in my feed. But now it’s working. I’m going to talk about the movie and I don’t want to give any of it away.

This was one of those surprise movies. I didn’t see any of it coming. When I first saw the trailer I though it was just another teen horror. But when the space channel mentioned about the directors release, I wondered, why would a teenie-bopper movie have a directors release? So I watched it. And wow!

See here is the point, where I put the more link. If you’ve seen the movie and would like to read on, click. If not, stop. If you just don’t care you can click anyway, but you might not get it all. So, here it is...

<small>**Doh!** - That wasn't fully captured. Right when I was getting to it. I'll see if I can find the rest</small>
