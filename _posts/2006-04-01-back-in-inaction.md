title: Back in inaction
---
I’ve been quiet, Mainly because I’ve been in TO working crazy hours in a room they call the “War Room”. With that name, you know it’s going to be crazy. However, A long flight, and I’m back home in Vancouver.

I’m sure I’ve got reams of emails and voicemails waiting, and I’ll get to them, one by one. But in the meantime I’ll share a drunk time poem.

Words flow like Leffe  
Sweet with a cinnamon taste  
Hints of Valentines  
Blurred by consumption  
One line dulls the heart  
One more the mind  
Verse after verse the  
Words mix and blur  
Eventually   
Creating only your desires  
My Key and strokes are  
Not my own  
Until the day after  
A trail of garments  
And a naked stranger  
Under your arm.
