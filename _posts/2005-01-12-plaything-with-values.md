title: Playing with values
---
Well thanks to Curt Rosengren and Steve Pavlina, I’m going to take Curt’s suggestion of play with Steve’s reminder of values and goals to create a play date for finding and assessing my values. I have goals set, but no values to help them out. I think I have an idea of why I’m having troubles with this independent venture. As Steve said in his article *“If you fail to focus your energy on the goals that are truly important to you, some of them will slip away, and that’s a heavy price to pay.”* To make things a little harder what happens when the goals you have complete conflict with the values? Well that’s what I’m hoping to find out today. I’ll keep you posted on the outcome.

A quick thought, organizations should go through this same process. Most big organizations and corporations have a way of creating and reviewing goals, but what happens when those goals conflict with the organizational values of the corporate culture? Probably not a good thing either.
