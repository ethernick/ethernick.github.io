Came across a nice application of [Google Suggest](https://web.archive.org/web/20060210032452/http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en)-like drop down. Take a look and this [dictionary](https://web.archive.org/web/20060210032452/http://www.objectgraph.com/dictionary/).

However it does make me a little urked. Not friken mad, but mildly concerned. Because when Google does it, the world follows suit. Why? There code isn’t out in left field. This isn’t a ground breaker by far. Turn off javascript and it’s broken. It makes me wonder if they are they really built this from scratch, or has google just jumped on the regurgitation bandwagon. Sure, it could have been them. They are, after all, a bunch of smart cookies, but common. So, I’ll ask my question out to the universe, who did it first? And while you’re at the act of answering, maybe you could answer who’s doing it better?
