<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been kicking myself for not blogging on Rensense. I saw it, I looked at it, but when it came down to it, there was always a reason why I didn’t.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m not doing enough <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">hustle 2.0</a></li>
<li>I’m just downright lazy</li>
<li>I’m legitimately tiered</li>
<li>I don’t have any topics</li>
<li>Where is my inspiration?</li>
<li>It’s easy…what’s wrong?</li>
<li>Why can’t I do this simple little thing?</li>
<li>Something is wrong with me</li>
<li><i>[insert downward spiral of thoughts here]</i></li>
</ul>
<p>And then the final ( and this is in big bold lettering ) is:</p>
<p><b>My focus is elsewhere</b></p>
<p>And you know what. It’s snapped me out of it. Because <b>that’s O.K.</b>!!</p>
<p>As I really think about it, I’ve got so many other things: school and radio ( they are one and the same, yet so different ), writing, client work, the menutia of life ( aka chores ) and helping my family. And there are loads of other things that sit in the cracks and wings. I do them, and I don’t even know I do them. I am busy! I can’t forget that.</p>
<p><b>It will be here when I come back to it</b></p>
<p>Oh! What’s this! I’m still blogging? Sure it’s been a few weeks, but I’ve still come back. There really is a funny perception of time that we all forget. a few weeks is not a lifetime. A few weeks does not mean it’s over. It simply means “a few weeks”</p>
<p>When was the last time, you just let it go, and realized it o.k. for you to be working on other things?</p>
