title: The Hunt for a Github Editor
---
I'm liking this whoe micro blog in github thing. Only thing is, when not at a fully prepped system, or on the road it would be nice to edit. So I'm on the hunt.

This particular little post is using [Prose.io](http://prose.io).

Not too shabby - I like the presuggested file with date. Would have liked prefilled metadata - or something to help suggest ( let's more honest - remember ) it.

ok. Hitting save - to see what happens.

**update**:

The publish flag is a nice add on - but wasn't visibile enough so had to take a second. And titles... not 100% sold on how those are working. Wasn't as intuative. Still does the trick though.

**update 2**

So many updates before the blog is even published. You know that title thing that wasn't intuative - well it wasn't a title, it was a full filepath. so... really not intuative. Meta Data it is.
