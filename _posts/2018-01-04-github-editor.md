I'm liking this whoe micro blog in github thing. Only thing is, when not at a fully prepped system, or on the road it would be nice to edit. So I'm on the hunt.

This particular little post is using [Prose.io](http://prose.io).

Not too shabby - I like the presuggested file with date. Would have liked prefilled metadata - or something to help suggest ( let's more honest - remember ) it.

ok. Hitting save - to see what happens.
