title: Bye bye Digg Reader
---
Another rss reader is biting the dust.

> Digg Reader if shutting down on marcher 26, 2018. Bummer, we know. Export and
download your feeds ad folder from digg.com/settings and you can add those to
another reader product. Don't worry! you can grab your feeds after Reader is gone.

Ok - where to next?
