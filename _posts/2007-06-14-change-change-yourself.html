<p>Through the blog world, I came across <a href="http://www.whatsyourmotto.com/Blogs/2007/06/11/change_your_world/">Change your World, Change The World</a>. Kevin Salwen highlighted some words shared on <a href="http://americandreamproject.org/">The American Dream Project</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If we are sick of foreign wars, make peace with our personal enemies.</li>
<li>If we are concerned with our nation’s debt, save our own money.</li>
<li>If we are sickened by materialism, buy only what we really value.</li>
<li>If we are concerned with global warming, conserve, walk, telecommute.</li>
<li>If we are worried about the environment, recycle, plant trees, grow something.</li>
<li>If we are angry with our leaders, propose and post real solutions.</li>
<li>If we are worried about health care costs, eat right, exercise, and sleep.</li>
<li>If we are worried about crime, drugs, and violence, participate in a neighborhood watch.</li>
<li>If we are sad about the decline of marriage, make ours the best example of commitment and fulfillment we can.</li>
<li>If we are worried about terrorists, put some boundaries between ourselves and those who use or abuse us.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I hope you can see what I’m trying to get at. These suggestions are simply metaphors for thinking about our lives. They are not meant to be absolute or literal statements. These are simply reminders that for every big overwhelming problem in the world, there is a version of it in our lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, I say, these are not metaphors; these should be absolute and literal statements. We all have the opportunity to lead by example. If we can’t change ourselves, how do we expect others to change?</p>
