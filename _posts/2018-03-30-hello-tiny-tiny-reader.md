title: Hello, tiny tiny reader
---
I've been obsesed for the past 2 weeks hunting for a replacement of Digg Reader. Found it 
in [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/tt-rss/wiki).

I feel so much better, now that I have my own feed of things to read daily. Under my own control, with my own choices. No AI
deciding and filtering what I should be reading.
