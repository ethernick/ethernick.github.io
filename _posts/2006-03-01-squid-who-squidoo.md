title: Squid-who? Squid-me. Squidoo.
---
As time progresses, I add in new tools. Lately [del.icio.us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060807235633/http://del.icio.us/nkempinski) has become the keeper of my bookmarks and [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/nkempinski) the keeper of my music. I didn’t want to bog my own blog down with too many sources, but I figured some people might like to see all of this in one quick snapshot. So…bring in a new tool: [Squidoo](https://web.archive.org/web/20060807235633/http://www.squidoo.com/tumbleweed/). My topic, simply me.

Right now I’m not that interesting...according to the stats, I’m ranked <s>11,706</s> 3,442 (update: since I posted this I’ve shot up tremendously in rank. Yeah!) . So I encourage visitors. I don’t care to be 1 but maybe a 3 digit ranking like 400ish, would be nice. Want to get a snapshot of me?
