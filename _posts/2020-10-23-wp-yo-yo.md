title: The Wordpress Yo-Yo

It's that time again. Github and gitpages you've been great. But I'm lazy. Lazier than lazy lately.
So it's time to head on back to wordpress. I'll be doing this slowly. So chances are, this site will flicker
and flub, maybe even a blorp to a final kapow!

Thanks for all the fish.
