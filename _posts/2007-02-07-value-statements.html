<p>At my company, the executive team is trying to boast that the company promotes “Open and timely communication”. However, their is a downfall in their support of this.</p>
<p><b>1. If you going to say “and”, do “and”.</b></p>
<p>The word “and” is a tricky one. Especially with value statements like this one. The word implies that both are present, and always present together. If you are timely with a piece of information but not very open, then you have failed in putting the statement into practice.</p>
<p>If you fail, then you loose the trust of those you’ve informed. And all of a sudden, there is miss-trust or the idea that you aren’t being honest. The value looses it’s meaning and simply become more clutter in corporate propaganda, then is rejected from the masses</p>
<p><b>2. Simple acts show your sincerity</b></p>
<p>Ah, there’s the rub! Really, this is the main reason I’m writing, and my big bug. Our office has just been renovated to follow the corporate scheme. And suddenly I noticed a inconspicuous door with a security swipe key. I looked through the small window and what do I see? It’s an almost secret executive only area.</p>
<p>Hmmm, “open and timely communication”. Open? How does a secret locked away executive only area say “Open” to the employees.</p>
<p>For offices that are multiple floors, I can understand that there might be a floor dedicated. But in out 2 floor small operation, the message this say’s speaks volumes!</p>
<p>You can say it, but your actions have just convinced me, you don’t believe it, you don’t want to believe it. And, sorry big wig exec, I don’t believe you.</p>
