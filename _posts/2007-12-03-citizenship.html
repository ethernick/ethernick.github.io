<p>If countries put as much effort into Citizenship as Companies put into performance reviews, maybe there would be 100% citizen participation.</p>
<p>Canada needs an HR department.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking with classmates who don’t get the point of Goals setting and value statements. All the stuff that every corporate machine goes through: Annual review, quarterly updates with your manager, progress reports. Everything that connects the employee’s to the business.</p>
<p>Then the tough occurred, that all these tools are to connect each employee and “try” to make them “care” and participate in the company. What if tax time was more then “taxes”. What if it was also a performance review of citizenship?</p>
<p>What are your goals as a citizen?<br />
Have you succeeded in meeting those goals?</p>
<p>Maybe based on our goals and the success of helping the countries goals, each citizen could get a bonus?</p>
<p>Maybe some sort of success multiplier?</p>
