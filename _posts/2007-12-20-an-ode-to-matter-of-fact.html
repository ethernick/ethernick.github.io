<p>This is an ode to matter of fact, in fact,<br />
a poem like evidentiary stone and stat.</p>
<p>For one plus one is two, not three,<br />
nor four or five, not twelve, indeed.<br />
Yet, far from mathematic postulations<br />
a soft and chewy sap awaits you.</p>
<p>A fact — In core of belly it sits and stays<br />
your course along a rocky plain or<br />
maybe through clear, already trodden path<br />
your feet, no matter, will eat their grass.</p>
<p>And if along the way that path does stray,<br />
your course, with force of will,<br />
shall tumble trees and shatter shale.<br />
What makes this “matter of fact” is inner still</p>
<p>“It is what is”, a need, a must,<br />
a “way it goes.” It thrusts<br />
from nock to tip, the target knows.<br />
Your life in sight, to loose, is right.</p>
<p>Some may ask “what is”, “what might”<br />
You disregard their shallow sight.<br />
Can light escape universal grip?<br />
Do elk or emu fret and flick?</p>
<p>I am what I am, no ands ifs or buts.<br />
I do what I do, no quips or bumps.<br />
Like one and one is two not fifteen<br />
I do what I do, matter of fact,  I’m me.</p>
