title: A new github.io
---
<p>Welcome to a clean ethernick.github.io. It was time to shutter the old and put it to bed... for now. You can still find the old posts <a href="https://github.com/ethernick/ethernick.github.io/tree/archive-2020">here</a>, and of course over at <a href="http://whoisnick.com">whoisnick.com</a>. </p>
<p>If you haven't been plahying along, it may come back. Nothing is ever over for me, and I'm <i>extermely</i> prone to changing my mind. For now, I'll try and and stick to geekness here. Though, be prepared it might be few and far between.</p>
<p>If you want more activity, be sure to all the juicey links on my <a href="/about">about</a>page.</p>
