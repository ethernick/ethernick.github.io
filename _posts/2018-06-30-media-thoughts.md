title: My Mind on Media

I've always thought about media. Sometimes, maybe my thoughts are behind the times.
Other times, I'm wondering who else in this world is having similar thoughts.

Maybe
it's all because I recently finished *Neil Postman's*
[Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6594462-amusing-ourselves-to-death).
Maybe it's because of the topsy turviness happening all around us. Maybe, I haven't
found, yet, the one person who's looking at, and talking about, media in the same
context.

Maybe if you know of someone you can let me know.
