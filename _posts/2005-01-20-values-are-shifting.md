If anyone has read [Values Shift](https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130286699/qid=1106242844/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_0_1/701-4436122-3309904),
then reading the new finding from [salary.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204095655/http://www.salary.com:80/advice/layoutscripts/advl_display.asp?tab=adv&cat=nocat&ser=Ser345&part=Par509),
or the post on [Worthwhile](https://web.archive.org/web/20050205202500/http://www.worthwhilemag.com/entry/2005/01/20/whos_surprised_by_this.php), isnâ€™t much surprised at all.
