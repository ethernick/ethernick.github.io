Read an interesting post. Must be the lack of morning coffee and it might be my personal insight into jazz. I 
saw this quote

“The humble improv”

Now in turn it seems that I read the quote wrong. The quote is actually from Wynton Marsalis, “The humble 
improve“. However, what I thought the quote was is still true. The humble really do improv.

In addition to Rajesh’s observation that: “If you lack humility, chances are that you think that you don’t 
need help and may not be OPEN to learning new things which in turn will limit your growth.”, being open to 
learning new things also means being open to falling flat on your ass. Learning is awkward and messy. There 
are times when we get it and fly and others we we bomb and die. In that way it is a lot like jazz improv.
