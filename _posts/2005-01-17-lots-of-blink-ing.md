title: Lot’s of Blink-ing going on
---
Well, this morning I had a chance to catch up on some blog reading. When you’ve got so many subscribed, it’s easy for the unread ones to pile up. And this morning it seemed that every post I was reading had some mention to a novel: [Blink](https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/qid=1106033518/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-4436122-3309904). So I used it as a sign and went out to purchase it. And I’m glad I did. I’m half way through already, and it’s a page turner into the unconscious mind. And now posts like Tom Peter’s “[Eye Sparkle Factor](http://tompeters.com/2005/01/the-eye-sparkle-factor/)” make so much sense.
