I miss the old del.icio.us. Yes, they have fumbled through the ownerships and are still running, but not the same. Maybe it's a vintage thing. I am 40, with a child on the way, I guess that's what you do.

I've gone to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:ethernick).

Sparse

Simple

Classic.

And Like posts - I know I've bookmarked things between 2014 and now. Maybe I'll see if I can find those too.

For now feel free to follow there, or just look at the new [Finds](/finds) page.
