<p><a href="http://ethernick.com">Ethernick.com</a> is now running off
  <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=bdaf86dd0a1dad89f9d4cb15e00f91ee3816c7b3">linode</a>.</p>
<p>Thought it was a good time to expand and play. Not many hosts are offering something
  relatively cheap to run node. I've been antsy to see how Ghost is doing
  in a real world context.</p>
<p>As of now, my previous medium hosted publication,
  <a href="http://a.ethernick.com">The aether</a>, has been moved onto ghost.</p>
