I've got a little idea stirring in my head.

If I could open a store, I think it would be a beer store. And like wine, it would
have beer organized from region. And the first I would make sure is to have all
of Canada.

I would have no idea where to begin to do this, but it would be nice.

But to start with - I'm at least going to start sharing what I have tried.
