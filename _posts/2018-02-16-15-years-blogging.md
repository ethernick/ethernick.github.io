title: 15 years blogging!?

It's an on again off again relationship, but I wasn't aware of time.

Almost [15 years](https://web.archive.org/web/20040801000000*/http://whoisnick.com/)!? Holy Internuts!

And this is just the proof I've found so far. I'm sure I've been doing this longer.

I've tried to make a [good archive here](https://github.com/ethernick/ethernick.github.io/tree/master/_posts), now you can expect back to 2004! Can I find even more?
