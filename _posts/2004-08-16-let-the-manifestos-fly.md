title: Let the manifestos fly
---
Today [Change This](http://changethis.com/): the fight club of the business world, launched it's first set of manifestos. I've only had a chance to read the first one, "[The Art of the Start](http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/1.ArtOfTheStart)" by Guy Kawasaki. I liked what it had to say. I'm still soaking in everything, but it comes at a good time for me. With me planning on diving into the world headlong by my own, this information comes to me at a very good time. [Originally](/theyre-all-going-to-talk-about-you) I had a bit of me being skeptical. I'm still looking to read the others, but so far so good. So, I'm doing my bit, to spread the word. Read On, my friends, read on.
