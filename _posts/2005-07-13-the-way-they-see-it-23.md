So Iâ€™m drinking my starbucks and I read on the back of their cup

> Chances are you are scared of fictions. Chances are you are only fleetingly happy. Chances are you know 
> much less than you think you do. Chances are you feel a little guilty. Chances are you want people to lie 
> to you. Perhaps the answer lies on the side of a coffee cup. You are lost. - David Cross, Comedian

This is from a comedian...so...is this supposed to be funny?
