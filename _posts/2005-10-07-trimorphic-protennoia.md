title: Trimorphic Protennoia
---
A quote come up from last nights creative class. I thought I would share

> I am Protennoia the Thought that dwells in the Light 
> She who exists before the All 
> I move in every creature
> I am the invisible One within the All
> I am perseption and Knoledge, uttering a Voice by means of Thought
> I am the real Voice.
> Trimorphic Protennoia

(Triple-formed Primal Thought)
