<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.twistimage.com/podcast/archives/spos-221---unlocking-creativity-and-your-accidental-genius-with-mark-levy/">Six Pixels of Separation #221</a>, and then read Mitch’s <a href="http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/7-things-that-blogging-does/">7 Things That Blogging Does</a> - and then something connected with me. Something I realized that slips through the cracks every so often.</p>
<blockquote><p>Blogging = Exhaust Valve. A great Blog is great because the Blogger actually cares and loves to create content. If it’s forced, if it’s your “job,” then the passion rarely comes through. The biggest lesson I have learned in my seven years of Blogging is that this Blog is my exhaust valve. After working a full day with clients and their many challenges, this Blog is my playground. It’s the place where I can let off some textual steam. Make your Blog your exhaust valve. Caution: be careful that you’re not Blogging simply to blow off angry steam. The steam and exhaust I am talking about is the pent up energy of passion that I have from doing what I love to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>When life’s little pressures build up I shut down. What I should be doing is the exact opposite. I should write more. I should be free writing and puking up all that crap in the exhaust system, and putting it down on paper ( digital or other wise ).</p>
<p><b>But Why Don’t I?</b></p>
<p>Maybe it’s something about conservation of words. This idea that a word not seen by the outside world is a wasted jewel. But then again, am I really that arrogant and cocky?… don’t answer.</p>
<p><b>Not A Resolution</b></p>
<p>I have said many times in the past that I vow to change. But this isn’t a resolution or promise to myself. It’s more an interesting observation.</p>
