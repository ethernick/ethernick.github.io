title: Dirty Dancin’ of Jazz
---
Had the pleasure of playing for a private blues dance tonight. ( I’m sure music will be coming soon ) OMFG! 
You wanna see some hot moves…man these cats ( and I mean the truest sense of the term ) they were in dancing 
heat. I kind of felt intrusive to watch a couple dancing, the way they were moving it was more then dancing. 
It was like sex with clothes on. If anyone says, “hey, you wanna go to a blues dance?” The answer is always 
yes.
