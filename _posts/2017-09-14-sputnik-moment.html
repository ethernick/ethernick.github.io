<p>Two things I like about <a href="http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/11/china-leaping-past-us-000509" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>

<p><b>One</b> - "Sputnik Moments"</p>

<blockquote>In recent months, China has quietly given the United States a series
  of new "Sputnik Moments"</blockquote>

<p>Although a tad fear mongering, still very very cool phrase</p>

<p><b>Two</b> - Quantum Communications</p>

<blockquote>China successfully tested the world’s first quantum satellite
  communication – relying on the physics of quantum entanglement to send and
  receive provably secure messages.</blockquote>

<p>I beg your pardon? What did it just say? <b>Quantum Satellite Communication</b></p>
