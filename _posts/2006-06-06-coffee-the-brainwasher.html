<p>Get it…wash? It’s a liquid! Get it?</p>
<p>Not sure if this is a good thing or not. An <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9280&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20">article on NewScientist.com</a> states “Drinking coffee makes you more open-minded” and on one hand that’s a good thing. But then goes on to say, “Moderate doses of caffeine can also make you more easily convinced by arguments that go against your beliefs”</p>
<p>Hun?</p>
<p>It’s good to be open minded, but “easily convinced”? For someone who drinks it religiously and addictively, does that make me flexible or someone that can be walked over? Does that make me adjustable or a hindu cow? Am I addicted to the caffeine or the relaxed perspective it gives me?</p>
<p>I know of some other substances that help people be open minded as well.</p>
