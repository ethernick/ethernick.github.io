title: Where is Nick? What’s he doing?

O.k. O.k. As some of my friends have pointed out to me, what good is a blog if you don’t use it. It’s been a long time since I’ve posted anything here. I kind of put little blinders on and focused completely on working and nothing about actually letting people know what’s going on. Half the fun about blogging is letting people know what’s going on and the discussions. So, when I found out how nice WordPress was, I thought, perfect! So here we go.

I’ve been talking about when I should have something up and running for people to see and play with. But I keep coming back and saying to myself it’s not ready. And at the same time, I’m looking around and everyone has there site in beta, which was a plan that I’ve been thinking of doing. But I’ve dropped that idea from my radar. I’m either going to have a site or not. I’m either going to show people what I’m doing or not. I came across a nice quote which was a great kick in the butt.

**You can’t build a reputation on what you are going to do.**

So, I’m going to change that. And I’m going to prove myself that I’m actually going forward.
