title: Years and Years: The Storyteller
---
I am hooked on [Years and Years](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8694364/). If you're a 
Black Mirror fan, and haven't already started watching, this should be your next show.

Spoilers.

Small spoilers.

Teeny tiny spoilers. 

The show follows a family over 15 years into the future. Nuff said about that.

A man meets a woman. They ask what each other does for a living. She is a Storyteller.

A Storyteller.

A storyteller as in sitting in a crowd using words. Ever one of those syllables taken 
in by those around. 

A storyteller as in myths, and fables. Lessons woven in metaphors.

Even the writers of a TV show, are feeling it. Orality.
