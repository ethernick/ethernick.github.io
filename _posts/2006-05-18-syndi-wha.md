title: Syndi-wha?

I’ve heard a rumour that some people don’t use a news aggregator like Google Reader. RSS might as well sand for “**R**eally it’s **S**omething **S**trange”. And for those of you who come by once in a while hoping for something new and heart broken to see the same post as before, I send my apologies your way. But I’m not one just to say sorry and forget about it. I like to correct the problem. I’ve added the ability to subscribe to my blog. No longer do you need to pop by and hope. If you sign up, I’ll send you an email and let you know I’ve made a change. Think of it like an invitation for Pie or Coffee.
