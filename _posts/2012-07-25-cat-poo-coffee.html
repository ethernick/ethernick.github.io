Called<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>“golden droppings,”<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>the beans are excreted from a stable of civet cats, which supposedly carefully select only the best beans to eat in the first place. Their digestive juices then penetrate the beans, and after they come back out of the cats they’re collected, cleaned (and cleaned and cleaned), and roasted. The result is a coffee that’s soft, rich, and not remotely bitter. Supposedly. And the result is expensive: In specialty coffee houses in London, a single cup of this Joe costs around $100.”</p>

<p>I knew there was a reason I called it “Cat Poo Coffee”</p>
<p>I tell friends it was some sort of marmot. But someone said, “that’s not a cat”. Oh…</p>
<p>It’s a civet cat.</p>
