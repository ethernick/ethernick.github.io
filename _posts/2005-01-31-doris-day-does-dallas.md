title: Doris Day Does Dallas?
---
It seems there was a mistake in a shipment of Doris Day DVD’s. The BBC reported, [Sex movie mix-up shocks couple](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/4212207.stm).

Now here’s the kicker.

The couple, regular attendees at their local Baptist church, settled down with a cup of tea to watch the 1957 musical... “My wife and I were very shocked but we watched it until the end because we couldn’t believe what we were seeing.”

When people are in shock they’ll watch just about anything! This was a mistake, but just turn the T.V. on and you’ll see this kind of stuff happening intentionally.
