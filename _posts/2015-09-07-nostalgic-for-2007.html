<p>I am a web waffler. I host my own blog. Then outsource is to another platform. Then host my own blog with a slightly different twist. Then dump it and move everything to tumblr. Then dump it again and move everything to Medium. Then host it. Dump it. Host it. Dump it.</p>
<p>Well it's back to hosting again and I was wondering what theme to use. so I looked into the way back machine. I forgot about some of the designs I've had.</p>
<p>The ultimate winner was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070809234114/http://whoisnick.com/" target="_blank">this 2007 chunky, text heavy, colour coded beast</a> <del>you see before you</del>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update March 12, 2016:</strong></em> Well that was the quickest turnaround on a layout I've ever had. No more! I say <a href="/fuck-the-fancy/">Fuck the Fancy</a>!</p>
