title: My Personality
---
I guess what I thought was a bad week has trickled into another. I knew challenges would be ahead and I knew there would be storms, and right now I’m in a doozie. Things aren’t full of joy and roses and a matter of fact, nervous tension is starting to build as this endeavour is starting to drain the bank account.

But, I’m not going to let that stop me from at least posting something to my blog. I can’t and I won’t. Blogging is great for the readers but even better for the blogger. It’s a great tool to push your own envelop. It keeps you looking and asking and searching for things. It helps me keep on my toes and regardless of what’s going on, everything I read I ask myself, “Is that something I should post about?” And if it could be I give is a shot.
This morning I remembered that I haven’t done a personality test in a while. For me it’s a fun thing thing. I thought I needed it considering the troubles I’ve been having. I needed the break. I like to keep up with them, to see how I’m doing, if I’m still the same or if I’ve changed over time. So far I’ve found good tests at [similarminds.com](http://similarminds.com/personality_tests_index.html). I personally like the [Jung+Enneagram](http://similarminds.com/embj.html). So I did it. My results haven’t changed since last time, here they are.

### Jung Type: ENFP

“Journalist”. Uncanny sense of the motivations of others. Life is an exciting drama. 8.1% of total population.

Nines are calm, laid-back, and optimistic. They are able to see everyone’s point of view and have a natural desire for peace. Nines are effective mediators. Fearful of conflict and separation from others, they may be too accommodating.

Your variant is sexual: sx/sp/so
