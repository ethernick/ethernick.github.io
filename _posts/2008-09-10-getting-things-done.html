<p>I’ve been feeling that with me learning to be more diverse in the way I look at things, and think about things. And the more I let myself out of the box, the more I have moments that I have so many things racing, that I just stop everything. So, over the past week I’ve been devouring “Getting Things Done”.</p>
<p>It’s been on my list for several years, and it’s only been recently that it’s raised in priority to the top.</p>
<p>I joke with friends that it’s a catch-22. You put “Getting Things Done” on the list of book to read, but becuase you haven’t read it, how can you get it done?</p>
<p>They sometimes chuckle, and sometimes don’t. It’s a tough crowed.</p>
<p>I was surprise with the tone of the book, and the awareness of creative styles, and creative inputs. No where does David Allen say it “has” to be this way. It’s the philosophy that he’s trying to impart; the “what’s the next action?” philosophy.</p>
<p>It’s going to take some time to get the action down to the specific next action, as I like to generally stay in the upper ionosphere of thought. No more generic tasks like “Figure out my process”, now it’s more directed, like “Read Getting Things Done” or “Do Exercise 1 on ‘Is Your Genius At Work’” Figuring out my process is the project, and the ultimate goal, but these would be my next “physical actions” to figuring it out.</p>
<p>There are loads if “thinking” tasks, and “brainstorming” tasks. A few “look on the web for” tasks. And from what I’ve read, that’s o.k.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s not about the structure, but the next task in to get there.</p>
<p>I’ll check back in a month and let you know how it’s going.</p>
