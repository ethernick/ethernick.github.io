<p>One of the biggest steps I ever made in my life was admitting “I don’t know what I don’t know”.</p>
<p>I needed help.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, I found my coach - Dari. (I’ll be talking about her more as we go along )</p>
<p>I’ve been reading Brian Greene’s, “The fabric of the cosmos”. And there is an interesting principle that we are all immersed in a Higgs ocean. It’s like the original idea of the aether. We are all subject to the field. Our mass is a result of friction between it and out particles.</p>
<p>But what sparked me was the analogy used to explain it. A frog in a dish, with food in the middle. Not only did it show the idea of Higgs field, but it also showed one of the principles of “You don’t know what you don’t know”</p>
<p>Take a bowl and put some food in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Take a frog and put it in the bottom of the bowl. ( His analogy has hot water, and the frog jumping all over the place, but that’s because of universal cooling. Although this is very fascinating, not where I’m going with it. So just putting the frog in the bowl will do ).</p>
<p>Now, in his explanation of the Higgs field, the dish is shaped like a tin for making a ring cake. One with a deep trough, and a pillar in the middle - like an island.</p>
<p>The food is in the very middle, at the top of the pillar.</p>
<p>The frog is at rest at the very bottom of the trough. Or even better, let’s say that the trough is so deep that the frog could even jump half way up the dish.</p>
<p>Can the frog see the food? No. But that doesn’t mean it’s not there.</p>
<p>If someone who wasn’t “in it”, could they see the food? Of course they can.</p>
<p>If you are the frog, then who sees the food?</p>
