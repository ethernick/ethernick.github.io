<p>After posting <a href="/you-need-to-have-faith-that-it-will-pan-out-take">Faith in the Process</a> I came across <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism.html">Richard Dawkins</a>.</p>
<p>He uses the term faith synonymously with religious and that surprises me. I use that word a lot, but I don’t think of it in the same way.</p>
<p>Dawkins has said</p>
<blockquote><p>Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is that with a capital “F”?</p>
<p>I don’t mean religion when I say it. I mean a deeper sense of trust.</p>
<p><strong>What else do you call that driving feeling when going against the grain of the world?</strong></p>
