<p>Astrology is a mixed bag of entertainment and advise. There are those that make these statements that pretty much apply to almost anyone: “You will find something you thought was lost.” So, when you think you’ve lost your key’s and find them again, WOW!</p>
<p>So, why do I even read them?</p>
<p>Sometimes I just need a laugh and a moment of escape. It’s like reading the bus signs on the way to school — you know they won’t be any good, but at least it’s something to do.</p>
<p>Other times, I need something that let’s me know I’m not completely loosing it. But for these times, I don’t just flip open 24 or The Metro.</p>
<p>Introduce, Rob Brezsny. Not only are his horoscopes entertaining buy they’ve got a rare insight and perspective I don’t see anywhere else. Take this week for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sagittarius</p>
<p>Here’s the first thing you need to know about the current state of your destiny: “Everything is blooming most recklessly; if it were voices instead of colors, there would be an unbelievable shrieking into the heart of the night.” That message comes to you from poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Here’s the second piece of wisdom you should take with you everywhere you go. It’s from Vladimir Nabokov: “For aren’t you and I gods? Let all of life be an unfettered howl. Release life’s rapture. Everything is blooming. Everything is flying. Everything is screaming. Laughter. Running.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this right? Well, I’ll leave that for my own craziness. But, just to let you know, I think it is.</p>
<p>Take a look at his site, <a href="http://www.freewillastrology.com/horoscopes">freewillastrology.com/horoscopes</a>. If he doesn’t get it right, at least you’ll have a good moment of escape.</p>
