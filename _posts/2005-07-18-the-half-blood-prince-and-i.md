title: The Half-Blood Prince and I
---
Yes, I’m one of the billions hooked on Harry Potter. And unlike those pretentious people who buy the “adult” 
cover books, I’m not afraid to admit it. When I first saw the photographic like covers on the shelves I was 
slightly disturbed. Isn’t there a phrase…hmm…let me think. It’s something about judging…and covers. I think 
this is very appropriate because it also has something to do with books. Now what was that phrase? Oh anyway, 
I’m once again delving my attention into J.K. Rowlings’ world.

It’s funny really. I seem to have a very select handful of topics that I can actually read through without 
falling asleep: quantum physics, leadership and harry potter. Yeah...it baffles me too.
