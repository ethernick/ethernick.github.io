title: I’m Inconclusive
---
I finished [Blink](https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/qid=1106033518/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-4436122-3309904) , and I found it enthralling. I just couldn’t put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding out more on how we all tick.

In it, there is a site address to take your own [Implicit Association Test (IAT)](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/). This test is a nice understanding of the unconscious decisions and feelings locked away. It’s pretty cool, mind you I’ve taken a bunch and I keep coming back inconclusive. What does that mean?
