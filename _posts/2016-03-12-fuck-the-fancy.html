<p>It's time to get back to basics. I think I was hiding behind the "design" - like being insecure in an awesome suit. You can fake it till you make it, sure. But I've been doing this long enough, That I shouldn't have to fake it.</p>
<p>AndÂ here we are, wordpress theme twenty-sixteen. No need to be fancy. It's good. It does the job. It's the content that matters, not how many fancy columns and boxes I put everything in.</p>
