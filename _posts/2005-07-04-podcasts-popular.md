title: PodCasts Popular?
---
It seems that with the launch of the new Podcast Subscriptions through iTunes, they had more then [One Million](http://appleinsider.com/article/?id=1159) subscribers in less 2 days. That’s just the number of subscribers. How many are out there that submitted their podcasts?

I must admit, it’s something that I’ve been thinking about. Could I have some form of regular weekly PodCast? I’ve got the software and the hardware to do it…hmmm. Maybe something for the idea block, maybe I could piggy back between blogging and podding.
