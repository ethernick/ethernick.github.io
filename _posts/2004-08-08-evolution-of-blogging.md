I came across this interesting article by Trevor Cook: [Blogging, why do we do it?](http://trevorcook.typepad.com/weblog/2004/07/blogging_why_do.html). It brings up some interesting questions about the potential evolution and possible downfall of blogging. What is the next evolution? - my opinion, lookup [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).
