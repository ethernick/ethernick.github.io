<p>As you’ve seen from my observations on <a href="http://whoisnick.com/avatar-the-renaissance-soul">Avatar</a>, I’m a cartoon lover. There is something in the art of teaching our children that bring out things that are “deceptively simple.” Stories that are to the point, and yet, when watched again have a beautiful complexity.</p>
<p>Case in point - Wall-E ( yes, it’s taken me long enough to get around to actually watching it )</p>
<p>On one hand, you have a love story.</p>
<p>On the other, you have a robot, logical in nature, who is inquisitive and is a <b>catalyst for change</b>. Simply by his curiosity for people and things; simply by doing something different: things happen around him. If you haven’t seen it yet, I strongly recommend you watch it.</p>
<p>Remember when you watch it <a href="http://whoisnick.com/chaos-creativity">chaos = change. change = creativity.</a></p>
