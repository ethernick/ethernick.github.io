title: What is EPIC?
---
Came across [this](http://www.broom.org/epic/) on Alan Meckler’s Blog. It’s an interesting theory of the future and what could happen. It’s got a pretty freaky undertone, especially when Seth posted [this](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/the_end_of_cand.html).

Sure makes me wonder about the integrity and truth behind the future of all information, not just blogging. What year is this...1984?

[Update: Guess I should be paying more attention. There is a [Blogging, Journalism & Credibility Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20060210032452/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/webcred/) going on. Nice.]
