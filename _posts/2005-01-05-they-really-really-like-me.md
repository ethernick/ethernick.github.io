title: They Like Me. They Really Really Like Me
---
I don’t know who they are, but I’m sending out a nice thank you to the 3 people who thought my collection of poems were good enough to purchase. Sure it’s been a couple of months since I submitted 4 copies, but considering the competition on the shelves I’m pretty stoked about that. So to the universe I scream, thank you!

I have a thought that’s purple  
Well, it’s more purple with orange swirls  
It’s kinda Happy  
It’s kinda Angry  
It’s like daisies in the spring  
and Bears in the winter
