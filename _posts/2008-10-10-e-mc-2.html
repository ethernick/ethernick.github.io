<p>Growing up, my dad tried to explain to me E = mc^2. He did a horrible job, and came up with an odd explanation, but at the time, seemed to appease my curiosity, and I moved on.</p>
<p><b>But his explanation was this:</b></p>
<p>The energy (e) you need to influence an object is equal to how heavy you are (mass or m) times two times the amount you can eat (consumption = c).</p>
<p>Throw all this light speed stuff, relativity, conservation of energy hocus pocus out the door. Einstein be damned. I think my dad might just have something here.</p>
<p><b>Where Am I Going With This?</b></p>
<p>The past couple of weeks I’ve been feeling all toasted. I’ve been frazzled, and absent minded. I’ve even been sleeping in. Simply Put I’ve been drained.</p>
<p>Why? Well at first I thought I was coming down with a flu. But no sniffles, no unexpected coughs, nothing. Then I realized maybe, it’s because I’ve been using all my energy. I’ve been running at school non stop for 12-14 hour days. Not just learning, but also running evolution1709.com.</p>
<p>In all of this I haven’t been refilling the batteries. I haven’t been getting any energy back. The output of energy is not the same as input.</p>
<p><b>Back to my Dad’s E = mc^2</b></p>
<p><b>E = Energy</b><br />
Think of this as any kind of energy. The energy simply to wake up in the morning. The juice it takes to get a report done, or assignment.</p>
<p><b>m = Mass</b><br />
This is a perceived Mass. How heavy does it weight. In terms of paperwork, it could actually be how heavy the paperwork (if so, I’m very sorry. That must be a bitch in the suitcase). It could just be one paper like a marriage certificate, or lease which will change your life forever, which is just a heavy on your mind, some might consider more heavy.</p>
<p><b>c = Consumption</b><br />
You can think of it plainly as food, but I like to think about it as things I need. Things like creative consumption, and intellectual consumption, emotions consumption…</p>
<p>Input of any kind, really. And, the kind of input that makes you full - satisfying like a turkey dinner.</p>
<p>The nifty thing is, when you get these kinds of consumption, a little goes a long way. You have one small moment of satisfaction and that can last the rest of the week, or even the month.</p>
<p><b>What’s The Deal with Renaissance Soul?</b></p>
<p>Really the whole equation here, is a fancy way - and a nice reminder kind of way, that we need to feed ourselves. In every way.</p>
<p>For renaissance, I think this balance is even more crucial. We need to watch it every day. For me I need to make sure this balance is in finer tune. Because when it’s out of whack, everything is out of whack.</p>
<p>I think because of the renaissance juggle.</p>
<p>We juggle several interests at once. And when one arm becomes tired, the balls fall to the floor. Next thing you know, instead of only doing a couple of our interests, we become so exhausted, we don’t do any.</p>
<p>And that just creates a bigger downward spiral.</p>
<p><b>In The End</b></p>
<p>I’m going to try and remember E = mc^2 everyday ( Hell, easy to remember was one of Einstein’s goals, I think he did just fine).</p>
<p><b>How do you balance?</b></p>
