<p>Over the past few weeks, <a href="http://lateralaction.com/articles/innovate-or-die-why-creativity-is-economic-priority-number-one/">LateralAction.com</a> has been releasing teaser flash video’s of <a href="http://lateralaction.com/video/episodes/meet-lou/">Lou</a>, <a href="http://lateralaction.com/video/episodes/meet-jack/">Jack</a> and <a href="http://lateralaction.com/video/episodes/meet-marla/">Marla</a>. Well now we have text.</p>
<p>I’m interested to see where the blog goes, but so far, it looks very promising for any renaissance soul.</p>
<p>Co-founder Mark McGuinness, also of <a href="http://www.wishfulthinking.co.uk/blog/">wishfulthinking.co.uk</a>, takes a hard stance on the necessity for creatives and conceptual thinkers.</p>
<blockquote><p>creativity isn’t a nice-to-have or a fun-to-do, it’s a matter of economic survival. Complex, challenging creative work is (so far) difficult to automate or outsource cheaply overseas. Creativity is what transforms utilitarian products into distinctive artifacts that are a pleasure to look at and a joy to use. It’s what makes people queue for days to get their hands on an iPhone, ignoring the clever friend who tells them they can get a “technically superior” alternative for half the price.</p></blockquote>
