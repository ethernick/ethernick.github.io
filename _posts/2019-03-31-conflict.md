My head is all jumbled. Conflcts of priorities. My therapists has a wonderful word for this: __Confuckeded__.

And when I am, I do something to break the pattern. To make a small step towards something. This post - considering 
I haven't posted in more than 9 months is just that small step. 

What's my next step?
