<p><i>Wrote an interesting little piece in creative class the other day. It was a moment when you hear the characters voice crisply, and it’s more dictation. Especially this, which was an odd mix of slang. Wasn’t sure what I was writing until I looked it over again.</i></p>
<p>The telephone rang. I looked at the call display to see who it was</p>
<p>“Oh - My - God! Like, you totally won’t believe!”</p>
<p>I saw the number, I saw the name, and yet I sill picked up the phone. Why?</p>
<p>“So Dave went to Lisa’s and totally found her tets up and snoggin Janet. She was like shocked. And he was like, shocked!”</p>
<p>Why? You’d think after a lifetime of listing to your little sister dish all the latest gossip, the voice wouldn’t sound like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p>“He asked if he could play too, but she just slammed palm on his specs. I mean, It ain’t pussy foot it they tri’d. But, you need a reboot on her thoughts. I mean seriously - with out her monkey toy it ain’t banana cream; it’s just pie.”</p>
<p>Half the time I had no clue. Where does she get these terms?</p>
<p>“Turns out she’s been fakin his grades for a semester. He ain’t her localhost and she’s changed providers! Hell she’s gone from packet to ping! We are talkin, like some serious backbone overhaul.”</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>“So, like, he went from hotmail to gmail, re-proped his DNS and is looking for a new server.”</p>
<p>With that she hung up the phone. What did she say?</p>
