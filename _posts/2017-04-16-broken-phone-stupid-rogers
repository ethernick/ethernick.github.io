<p>My iPhone 5C is dead.</p>
<p>Again</p>
<p>I thought we had lost it, but a friend saved it. Then in my excitment to tell the story of the saved iPhone, 
I chucked it across the room and now the screen is broken. Dead again</p>
<p>Rogers now wants to charge me a stupid amount of money for <i>not</i> the newest iPhone 6.... ummmm?? What?</p>
<p>So until I come up with either some $$ or another plan... it shall remain dead.</p>
