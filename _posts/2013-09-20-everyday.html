<h3 id="3c2e" class="graf--h3">What do you do everyday?</h3>
<p id="2849" class="graf--p">I came across this <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://photooftheday.hughcrawford.com/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://photooftheday.hughcrawford.com/">Photo Of The Day</a> project, via <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://fstoppers.com/photographer-makes-an-image-every-day-until-the-day-he-dies" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://fstoppers.com/photographer-makes-an-image-every-day-until-the-day-he-dies">fstoppers</a>, which spanned 18 years of one mans life. I was moved by the story, amazed that one photo showed the dynamic range of life, and ultimately saddened from the last photo’s documenting his death.</p>
<p id="b8c3" class="graf--p">I struggle with repetition and patterns. Always have.</p>
<p id="221f" class="graf--p">I’m sure there’s some sort of child-like fight internally happening. Probably a neurological neighbour that still makes my face cringe as an adult while trying to eat my veggies.</p>
<p id="72e2" class="graf--p">I’ve tried various things to create routine. I see the importance and the power of it. And yet when I try, it slips through my fingers ( And, no. 20 days does not make a habit. I’ve had things I’ve done longer vanish ). It’s like this unconscious struggle telling me “No, no. You did that yesterday, so how’s about you don’t do that today.”</p>
<h4 id="3f26" class="graf--h4">No solutions here</h4>
<p id="500d" class="graf--p graf--last">I have no solutions today. Just a comment and a question. How do you get yourself to do something every day?</p>
