title: Going 2.0

The festivus and gatherings are quiet. I’ve somehow ended up in the office working away through the candy hangover. Why I’m supposed to be in the office for the next three days is a mystery however, the lack of people make it for nice catch-up time. I’m able to do all the dreaded paperwork and documentation and as an added bonus, I’ve been able to sneak in an upgrade of my site from Wordpress 1.5 to the new and flashy 2.0, yeah!

And now back to our quieter then normal programming…
