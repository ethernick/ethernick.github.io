<p><a href="http://m.ctv.ca/topstories/20120602/couple-to-wed-balk-at-extra-music-fees-120602.html">If you play music I hope you've got some money in the bank</a></p>
<div class="link_description">
<p>If you play music in a venue or parade or festival? Get ready for an invoice from the Canadian Government.</p>
<blockquote><p>… the Copyright Board of Canada recently approved new fees to play recorded music at large gatherings, including weddings.</p>
<p>The fees – which also apply to events and venues such as parades, festivals, and karaoke bars – are being charged in an effort to protect and compensate performers and record labels for their work.</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s more important to note</p>
<blockquote><p>The new fees are retro-active to 2008, meaning people may receive a bill for an event they’ve thrown in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example if you run a night club ( assuming you’re only open 4 days a week ):</p>
<p>$55.52 x 4 x 52 = <b>$11,548.16 / yr</b><br />
Now - remember to times that by 4 years = <b>$46,192.64</b></p>
<p>If you’re open more than that, I hope you’ve got roughly $70,000 in your account.</p>
