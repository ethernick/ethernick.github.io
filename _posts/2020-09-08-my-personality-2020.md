title: My Personality (2020 Edition)

The past year has been a tough one. Let's distract myself for a moment to see how my personality test holds up to [last years](/my-personality-2019).

### Your type is: INFP

"Questor". High capacity for caring. Emotional face to the world. High sense of honor derived from internal values. 4.4% of total population.

Introverted (I) 67.74% / Extroverted (E) 32.26%  
Intuitive (N) 82.14% / Sensing (S) 17.86%  
Feeling (F) 73.33% / Thinking (T) 26.67%  
Perceiving (P) 80% / Judging (J) 20%  

| Type 1 | Orderliness | ``||||||`` | 30% |
| Type 2 | Helpfulness | ``||||||||||||||||||`` | 73% |
| Type 3 | Image Awareness | ``||||||||||||||`` | 53% |
| Type 4 | Individuality | ``||||||||||||||||||`` | 80% |
| Type 5 | Rationality | ``||||||||||`` | 33% |
| Type 6 | Cautiousness | ``||||`` | 16% |
| Type 7 | Adventurousness | ``	|||||||||||||||`` | 66% |
| Type 8 | Aggressiveness | ``||||||||||||`` | 46% |
| Type 9 | Calmness | ``||||||||||||||||||`` | 73% |


Your main type is **Type 4**

Your variant stacking is **spsxso**

| type | score | type behavior motivation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 24 | I must be unique/different to survive. |
| 2 | 22 | I must be helpful and caring to survive. |
| 9 | 22 | I must maintain peace/calm to survive. |
| 7 | 20 | I must be fun and entertained to survive. |
| 3 | 16 | I must be impressive and attractive to survive. |

High level - still INFP Type 4 with the same variant. Lower level - I seemed to have taken some of my rationality and replaced with aggressiveness. 
I think we all are feeling it. That - and my kid is 2. You try and survive that without a little more aggressiveness.

If you're curious about yours, this was made using the [Jung+Enneagram](http://similarminds.com/embj.html) test.
