title: Massive Change - The Thinknet
---
Got my recent [iconoculture](https://web.archive.org/web/20060127004744/http://www.iconoculture.com/)
in the mail. They had a piece about thinknets: cyber communities of thinktanks.
In particular it referenced [Massive Change](https://web.archive.org/web/20060127004744/http://www.massivechange.com/)
which is striving to be one of these. Their [forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20060127004744/http://forums.massivechange.com/index.php)
has some interesting topics. I don’t think it’s at the super “thinktank” level
yet, like the conscious city or anything like that, but it has good potential.
I’m keeping a watch on it. Maybe make a post or 2.
