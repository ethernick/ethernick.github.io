<p>When things are good and easy, I blog, I tweet &amp; I participate and share. When things aren’t so easy…. not so much</p>
<p>This is odd because no matter how crazy the world is, I work. To be more clear I work from home. That place that some of my friends are afraid of - where there is no boss checking in, where the tv beckons you to watch one more show. Sometimes even I’m surprised to find that somewhere between 8-9 I walk into my office and I work. Even when not at home, I find a place: in someone else’s office, in a dinning room, or in the coffee shop.</p>
<p>For a man that has attention issues and fights daily routine, this has somehow stuck - this “work”. So now it’s time to add social so that next time things aren’t going so well, I can keep calm and carry on.</p>
