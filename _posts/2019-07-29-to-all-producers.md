Hat's off to all of those who create.

I commend all of you who produce something with any form of regularity.

It's my weakness.

You do it through all the excuses. Through exhaustion. Through nervousness.
Through repetition. Through drinks with friends. Through desires to binge watch. Through child vomit.
Through partners to-do's. Through bill payments. Through little voices inside your head. Through sickness.
Through happiness. Through fear. Through success. Through confusion. Through it all.

You hit publish.
