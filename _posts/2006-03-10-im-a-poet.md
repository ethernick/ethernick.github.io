title: I’m A Poet
---
Could be the sleep deprivation. Could be the crazy gene waking up. Who knows. I decided to modernize an old poem about unlikely poets.

I’m A Poet   
I don’t know it   
My Feet show it   
They’re [Longfellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow)  
And they smell like the [Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens)...
... [Booooyyyyyyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Boyd_(novelist))!
