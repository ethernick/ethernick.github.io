title: George of The hour
---
I’ve seen a couple of instalments of [The Hour](http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/) and so far it’s a refreshing take to news. Previously, I stopped watching news or caring about news because quite frankly it sucks. All of it, the news; the people. Well, welcome George Stroumboulopoulos and welcome back caring about news! I love this new take. Congrats not just to George, but to the CBC for allowing this on the air. He started his interview “Hey Man, what’s happening”. Who does that?
