Last night was another performance by the illustrious Blue Morris 6 (+1). I’m sure Blue will be posting the 
outcome shortly, in which case you can then take a listen for yourself.

One thing that made this night different from others was the feedback from the audience. We’ve played other 
shows and when it’s done, I’m walking out the door and people are watching me leave with my huge case, but 
not saying anything. For this gig a bunch of people came up to us and said “nice show” or “I was really 
entertained, thank you”. To those out there who did, I say thank you. It really does make a difference.
