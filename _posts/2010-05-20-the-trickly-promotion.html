<p>I just saw <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/05/sort-of-private.html">this from Seth Godin</a> about a url shortener called <a href="http://trick.ly">trick.ly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can share a URL but hide it behind a question that only insiders can easily answer.</p>
<p>So, for example, you could tweet, “Here’s the source for my world-class chili: <a href="http://trick.ly/2L5">http://trick.ly/2L5</a>”. Anyone can go there, but only people who can figure out the clue can discover the site you were pointing to.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what caught my eye, is I had to scrounge for the answer. I had to goto his website and hunt for the result. I was hooked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can this be done in a facebook or twitter promo?</li>
<li>Can you use it to have people scouring through a clients website for an answer?</li>
<li>Can you engage your audience with it?</li>
<li>Can the hint have you listen for something at a specific time?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Yup.</b></p>
<p>I can think of several ways that this particular service can be repurposed to have fun with.</p>
<p>What can you come up with? I’d love to here them.</p>
