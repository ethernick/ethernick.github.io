title: Data, Data and more Data
---
I’m trying to find way’s to compile the data better. Quite frankly there are a billion and 3 places to get it from. As I time myself, getting the data in, is a management nightmare. I was thinking I might want to create a specialized crawler for the purpose to look out for events. However, I’ve never build one, so I need to take a look and learn. I’m not sure if that’s even the best way of going about it. Any ideas?
