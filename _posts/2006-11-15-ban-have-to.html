<p>I’ve been doing work around a personal aversion to the phrase “have to”. When I hear it, and especially when said to me, I always react “I don’t have to do anything”.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone “has to” do anything.</p>
<p>I say let’s use more descriptive “need to”, “should”, “obligated”, “would like to”. All of which are different then “have to”.</p>
<p>So why? Well, I believe this term is used and beaten with a stick. It’s a dead horse, so I suggest, let’s all get off.</p>
<p>“Have to” came around at the end of the 16th century, which is the end of the Renaissance. Is it a coincidence that for a time when everyone is running around the countryside asking “why”, that people came up with “because you have to”? They wanted a way to shut them up.</p>
<p>It’s used as a blanket statement for people who don’t know, or don’t want to know. It’s used for people who want compliance.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><b>Person 1:</b> “You have to [insert task here]”</p>
<p><b>Person 2:</b> “Why?”</p>
<p><b>Person 1:</b> “Because, you have to.”</p>
