<p>I’ve never been one for sitting down and making a list of things I want to accomplish. Reason being - 3 days in, the list has already changed.</p>
<p>Originally my resolute friends said my lists were too generic like: “more exercise, eat healthier food, blog more”</p>
<p>These were not concrete enough.</p>
<p>The next year my list was “Go for 20 minute walks every lunch hour; have carrots for dinner on thursdays; blog Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays”. I heard a resolving “yes” from my friends.</p>
<p>But then… I got bored.</p>
<p>I like to call myself an ebb-and-flow-kinda-guy. Routine and I don’t really get along. So, you could imagine that these regiments didn’t make it past the first week.</p>
<p>So now - I come up with a theme. Think of it like a musical score - and every scene I’m in, you can hear a Baritone Saxophone melody.</p>
<p>Here’s some examples</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve had “Fire” to put some urgency in my life</li>
<li>I’ve done the “Snake” to help me shed some things ( snake skin, get it? )</li>
<li>I’ve used “Earth” to find solid ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think you’ve got it?</p>
<p><b>So what am I going to do this year? </b></p>
<p>I’m thinking either a “Stereo Speaker” or a “Care Bear”.</p>
<p>Can you figure out why?</p>
