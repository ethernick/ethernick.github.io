title: eNetworking isn’t for me
---
So I’ve finally come to the conclusion that networking through the web isn’t a cup of tea for me. Matter of 
fact it isn’t even a cup of anything for me. I’m not in it. For me it’s too forced and not natural enough. I 
did go to one of the meet-ups but didn’t really get into it. I’m sure there are other meet-ups that are 
great, but right now in my life, not for me. So…the links are gone.
