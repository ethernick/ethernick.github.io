<p>I had a thought in class for a newspaper. What if newspapers had two or more articles on the same topic, but from different perspectives? Would that be of any use? Would it change readership? Would embracing bias and showing both sides of the bias, counteract it?</p>
<p>If not in the sense of traditional print media, then maybe a flag on google news that indicates, left wing, right wing or editorial? and maybe a view to see 2 articles side by side? On one side, the left wing, on the other, the right.</p>
<p>Anyone up for wring an app like that? Iâ€™d be up for using it.</p>
