Garr over at Presentation Zen has a great article on the Lessons Jazz can give everyday life. These lessons might come from the music world but can be used in any situation where 2 people are connecting.

2. “Writing is like jazz. It can be learned, but it can’t be taught.” (Paul Desmond)
3. “Don’t bullshit… just play.” (Wynton Marsalis)
4. “If they act too hip, you know they can’t play shit!” (Louis Armstrong)
5. “Master your instrument. Master the music. And then forget all that bullshit and just play.” (Charlie Parker)
6. “It’s taken me all my life to learn what not to play.” (Dizzy Gillespie)
