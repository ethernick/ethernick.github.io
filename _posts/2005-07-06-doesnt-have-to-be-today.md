title: Doesn’t Have To Be Today
---
Just because I’m thinking it, or typing it doesn’t mean that it should be published right away. ( oh! gasp! 
really??) Nope. So, what I’m going to play with over the next little while is using some of the features that 
have been put in [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), for they were designed for. Who knew? I’m going to use 
the timestamp…( oh! gasp! )...and the “draft” ( more gasping and maybe a couple of murmurs ). Matter of fact 
I’ve already started…this 
post alone was actually entered in 2 days ago, but didn’t show up till now ( ooo! aaah!).
