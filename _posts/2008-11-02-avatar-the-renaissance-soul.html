<p>I love cartoons. I don’t love every cartoon, but there is always at least one or two that peak my curiosity. Lately, the top on my list is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">Avatar: The Last Airbender.</a> Yes, it’s now over, but even afterward, it’s still top of the list.</p>
<p>The premise is simple. Take a world where there are four nations: Earth, Air, Water Fire. In these nations there are those born who can mold the element or “Bend” it. But there is one, The Avatar, who can Bend all four.</p>
<p>There are loads of great lessons that come out of a 30 minute story. But today I made a connection. The Avatar is a Renaissance Soul ( or for some of you a generalist) . Here is a society that is built on specializing in one element. And here comes a single individual that is looked up in this world to be able to bend several elements.</p>
<p>Unlike the story, I think that we have thousands of Avatars walking our streets and roaming our world. They have in them the ability to bend more then elements. One might bend Music and Math; another Leadership and Sewing. The combination are endless. What can you bend?</p>
