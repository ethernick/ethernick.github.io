title: Science Fiction should be far fetched
---
Most of the Sci Fi I watch now, I think...

 **"Ya - I can see that happening."**

*Black Mirror* has done too good of a job at laying out the plausible.

Even after watching Altered Carbon.

I still don't think most is that far fetched. And I think it should be.

I've seen glimpses that surprised me. Yet still - I'm thinking in my grand
children's time, maybe.

Maybe I've been watching too much...

Maybe I can't *watch* the kind of Sci Fi that I'm looking for.

I've been sitting on the genre sidelines too long. Time to pick up some books.

I'll let you know how it goes.
