Back in my post [Crying With Purpose](/crying-with-purpose) I found that with the exercise [Steve](https://www.stevepavlina.com/) had
discussed, the message of purpose that got to me was:

**To be at home with my head in the clouds and music in my heart.**

But after almost a month of thought, I’m stuck with one simple question. What
the @$#! does that mean? I mean, why couldn’t I have shed some tears over
something that made more sense! I’m sure with some more work I can translate this
into something, but for now I’m completely at a loss.
