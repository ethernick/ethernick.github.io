December blah's have been hitting. Haven't really been feeling so hot lately. Not too sure why. I think today is better. Got some things off my shoulders and now I think I'm actually starting to make progress on my little secret site. It's not really a secret. And for someone who is looking at being out there and open it's not really a good idea for me not to say anything.

Well the site is wherestheshow.com it's going to be an event calendar. Right now it's not much of anything, but on my localhost it's starting to come somewhere. Mind you it's taking forever!! I just need to keep taking in big breathes and remind myself of baby steps. Baby steps. Baby steps.
