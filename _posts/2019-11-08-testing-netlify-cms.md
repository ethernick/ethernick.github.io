Testing a [netlify cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) post. There's a few things I'm still wrapping my head around. But interesting so far.

**_Update:_** Well that was interesting. Did some strange post not found. But after refresh worked. Does it always do that?

**_Update 2020-09-08:_** Never used Netlify for this, so not as interesting as I thought.
