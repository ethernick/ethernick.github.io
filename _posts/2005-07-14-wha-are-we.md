title: Who are we...?
---
The warthogs? No. I started a small group class about tapping into our creativity and about creative writing. 
It’s held by a wonderful woman ( of which I probably will be referencing her as time goes by ) named Dari. 
With each class she has them come up with a name for themselves. With a little work and thought, we are 
**The Chrysalis**. Considering the [definition](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/chrysalis) I would say it’s 
a very fitting name.

<small>**[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa#Chrysalis)** has pretty much the same definition, but 
I thought I would connect to it...it’s looking a little barren. Know something? Share</small>
