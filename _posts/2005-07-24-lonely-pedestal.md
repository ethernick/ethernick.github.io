Wake up caged amongst the lost  
Walking through their world  
Look at the posters pointing  
The way not traveled has  
been traveled too much  
This world rich with illusion  
You think you’re found  
You think it’s wise  
To walk amongst the found  
is not travelling at all  
On a pedestal looking up  
In your caged Freedom  
I’m alive and drenched in  
the lonely  
The Lonely we are
