<p>Here is a debate to consider. You have several different skills, all of which you are passionate about. You don’t want to focus on just one - hence a Renaissance Soul.</p>
<p>View A - If you look hard enough, you can find an underlying calling, a genius that surrounds all of these things.</p>
<p>View B - They are distinct and separate. Don’t bother putting a pretty bow on them, you aren’t going to find one.</p>
<p>The jury is still out for me, but I’m using <i><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0891061940">Is Your Genius at Work</a></i> by Dick Richards, to help me find out for sure.</p>
