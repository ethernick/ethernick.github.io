<p>Late last night watching the Season 1 finale of Stargate: Atlantis ( I said Geekness ), One of the characters, Dr McKay, was frustrated by the bull headed leaders.</p>
<p>“They always say they don’t need the scientists until they need the scientists. By then it’s too late!” ( or something like that )</p>
<p>It’s not just on T.V. It’s not just “the scientists”. You can replace that with just about anything. Give it a try.</p>
<p><b>They always say they don’t need food until they need food. By then it’s too late!</b></p>
<p><b>They always say they don’t need <i>it</i> until they need <i>it</i>. By then it’s too late!</b></p>
