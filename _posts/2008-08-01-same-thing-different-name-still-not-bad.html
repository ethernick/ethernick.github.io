<p>There is a phrase floating around the web called a “lifestream”, and several sites are capitalizing on this new term. You too can have a lifestream! But remember Shakespeare and his line: “A rose by any other name…” still smells nice. Or my favorite, “same shit different pile”.</p>
<p>First, you need to know, that like anything else, when a new term is coined, everyone is “it”. It’s no different then any industry phrase. I remember this conversation</p>
<blockquote><p>Friend: “I’m ISO-9000 compliant.”</p>
<p>Me: “Oh, that’s nice. what is it”.</p>
<p>Friend: “It’s a framework for my company to effectively creat a QMS”</p>
<p>Me: “Yes, but what is it”</p>
<p>Friend: “Well it’s a binder with specific details about my products and organizational work flows”</p>
<p>Me: “Didn’t you have that before?”</p>
<p>Friend: “Yes, but it’s in a new template!”</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn’t any different then let’s say web 2.0</p>
<blockquote><p>Friend: “My site is web 2.0.”</p>
<p>Me: “Oh, that’s nice. what is it”.</p>
<p>Friend: “It’s a conceptual framework for combining web technologies for user interaction.”</p>
<p>Me: “Yes, but what is it”</p>
<p>Friend: “Well I’m using RSS, AJAX, and various other scripts to add more dynamic content”</p>
<p>Me: “Didn’t you have that before?”</p>
<p>Friend: “Yes, but it’s got gradients!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, you probably have the question I asked my friends “Yes, but what is it?” It’s another log / blog / news feed, of things you’ve been touching and updating on the web. It’s supposed to be a one stop shop. “Look, Nick has a new bookmark.”, “What’s that, Nick? You’ve put a new poem up on pownce?”, “Nick, you’re blogging again?”.</p>
<p>You may have seen this kind of stuff before, only it wasn’t called a “lifestream”. You know on facebook, how you have a list of friends activities? Things they’ve done on facebook? Well…that’s a lifestream. Take a look at friendfeed.com and they are by far the best I’ve come across. Simple and to the point. I guess that’s becuase they don’t even use the phrase “lifestream” at all.</p>
<p><b>My round the bend and over the stream ( get it! ) point</b></p>
<p>Regardless of what it’s called, if you are an active user on several sites, consider finding a place to tie them in a pretty bow. First of all, it will let your friends see your presence on the web ( not for everyone I know, but for those marketers, it’s extremely powerful ). And second, I find it puts in my mind, which sites I use, and reminds me why I use them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Pownce is for poetry</span><br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/ethernick">Twitter is for what I’m doing</a><br />
Tumblr is for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">shitz and giggles</span> blogging<br />
<a href="http://friendfeed.com/nkempinski">Friendfeed is my lifestream</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">( well I have a copy here too )</span></p>
<p>(<b>update:</b> I guess the services I use have changed a bit since 2008. Maybe it’s time for a new list?)</p>
