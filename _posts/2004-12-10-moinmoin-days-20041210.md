Just coding coding coding. Keep coding coding coding. That seems to be the only thing I'm doing lately. It takes thousands upon thousands of lines of code to get to the point where I want to be. It's like a mountain climber looking at a mountain that's just that little bit too high. This kind of mountain is definitely going to need the rope.
They say to expand your self by biting off more then you can chew. You need to shoot for the stars because if you only shoot for the end of the road you will always get there and never have to try new things to do so. Well I'm starting to feel the frustration of shooting for the stars. My little project of course is taking longer...way longer then I ever anticipated, but it's baby steps. The sad thing is I don't even have anything in the outside world to show my progress. Oh well, I'll get there.

Mind you out of all of this turmoil I've come to the conclusion that apache mod_rewrite is the coolest thing in the whole wide world. I haven't even begun and I'm only at the tip of the iceberg, but if you get a chance, give it a shot.
