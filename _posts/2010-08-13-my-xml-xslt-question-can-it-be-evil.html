<p>I’ve been playing with XML &amp; XSLT on and off for 6 years. I’ve toyed with parser scripts. I think, at some point, I even wasted a few days making an ant compiler to generate a static site for a client of mine… but that’s as far as it went.</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to play again and set up an experimental playground over at <a href="http://ethernick.com">ethernick.com</a>. What’s fun about it ( “there’s no place like 127.0.0.1” kinda fun ), is that it’s all XML. Right now, there isn’t a single html page. I’ve parsed out RSS &amp; RDF, plus i’ve even applied XSLT to a quasi-HTML index page. <b>But don’t let the letters fool you, it’s not HTML.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Nick+Kempinski">What caught my eye</a>, was that although the very first page is “.xml” and it uses XML doctypes and XSLT calls, Google decided to index it as if it where HTML. So I added a fake</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Nick+Kempinski"><img class="alignleft" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1yw5wFlwO1qz5zo6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>What I ended up thinking is - if Google sees something else, is this a potential hole for scamming? Here’s the story I play out in my mind:</p>
<p>Say I work for a seedy business. And at that business my job is to lure unsuspecting people to see my site. These unsuspecting people may be even be fooled to click on a link or two. And while people are clicking away to unauthorized sites and scammy links, Google doesn’t see any of it. They are unsuspecting, because to them, it’s a little page with a couple of paragraphs.</p>
<p>Now…I admit this isn’t fully thought out. I admit that there are holes. I’m wondering, in real world practicality, why would someone make a page for real-estate, and then show them porn. It’s more of a surprise factor than anything. So, is it really a problem after all?</p>
<p>I don’t know. But I guess that’s why it’s an experiment. I guess the discussion is open.</p>
