<p id="b996" class="graf--p">What dreams must come to Mothers minds<br />
when hand of God shall crack the sky,<br />
and rage away the troubled times<br />
for perfect moments relief,<br />
and breath.</p>
<p id="7e92" class="graf--p">Fresh weathered air<br />
after tumbled trees and shaken nest.<br />
When children hide and peak in wonderment,<br />
knowing beauty in such natured strength.<br />
The shutters flap and quake<br />
about smacking harshly against the house.<br />
And with a whack,<br />
a clouded broom wipes all away<br />
the greys, replaced by light and breeze<br />
relief,<br />
a breath</p>
<p id="68b5" class="graf--p">All the while she sleeps.<br />
The storm her mind like R.E.M.<br />
with visions of ages that call upon her depth.<br />
When once that swam took first step<br />
along rockenâ€™d tip of skin,<br />
or muffled crunch of those she loved striving to survive<br />
while she entwined in cold lament.<br />
Perhaps, she visions like we -<br />
of happy days or strange desires.<br />
Perhaps, she dreams of elemental fires.</p>
<p id="a55b" class="graf--p">No Matter</p>
<p id="4c24" class="graf--p graf--last">Like flesh and blood<br />
to mount and mud.<br />
Dreams do come to our dearest Mom.<br />
After streak of sky and turbulence,<br />
a peaceful time,<br />
she takes<br />
a breath.</p>
