I'm going through some of my chicken scratch that I've collected in my book of scribbles and came across some poetry. No relevance to anything really, I just liked it.

***

Kateri wraps in tight  
Holds with might  
She's just fine don't  
mind the sight

Kateri's got her quill  
it's her thrill  
hematic pill  
grisly thrill

benevolent malignity  
persecuted generosity
masochistic clemency  
sentimental agony

Kateri's got her quill  
it's her thrill  
push in tight  
it has to be real
