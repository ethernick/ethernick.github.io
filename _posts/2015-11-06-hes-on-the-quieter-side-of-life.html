<p>Back from the honeymoon. And feeling silent. Not much tweeting, not much sharing. Sitting in a little cocoon, I think. I might be waiting, searching for something next. Not sure exactly what it is, but I know it's stewing in the fallow.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The life of a creator is not the only life nor perhaps the most interesting which a man leads. There is a time for play and a time for work, a time for creation and a time for lying fallow. And there is a time, glorious too in its own way, when one scarcely exists, when one is a complete void. I mean / when boredom seems the very stuff of life.”<br />
- Henry Miller</p></blockquote>
