title: Springing Late
---
I did it again! I missed the first day of Spring last year, and I missed it again! For others it might not be a big deal, however Spring Solstice is one of the most important celebrations. Why? New beginnings; rebirth. There is a reason why it’s called “spring cleaning”. It’s the real New Year. Nature wakes up again; refreshed. As a tradition for the spring I read over the story of **[Jumping Mouse](/jumping-mouse)**. So many lessons so many analogies.
