<p>You need to have faith that it will pan out. Take it from experience and wisdom. Take it from Twyla Tharp.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s about making the dance, in my case, that you’re really curious about and trusting that others will be interested in it and that if it has a sincerity and a truthfulness to it and if you really tried something in it - and guess what? You guessed right! And it has a really wonderful feel to it people will sense that and all this other stuff will come.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is “this other stuff”? The stuff you need, the stuff you want, the stuff you dream of. A classic tale of “Build it and they will come.”</p>
<p><b>Do it becuase you do</b><br />
I always forget this one. A classic blunder on my side. I sometimes get wrapped in the minutia, or the striving for perfection. Sometimes I even get bogged down by asking “what’s the point?” The point is to just keep doing it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I never thought I was going to make an income. I never thought I was going to earn a living doing it. I just was curious about doing it…We did dance because that’s what we were really challenged to do.</p></blockquote>
