<p id="7f2e" class="graf--p">Who knew the stories we read as kids, might actually be true? Whaa!?</p>
<p id="d42b" class="graf--p">It’s now a scientific fact that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/your-thoughts-can-release-abilities-beyond-normal-limits-2013-8" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/your-thoughts-can-release-abilities-beyond-normal-limits-2013-8">if you think you can do it, you’re more likely to be able to do it</a>.</p>
<blockquote id="f73e" class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--last"><p>“Psychologists Ulrich Weger and Stephen Loughnan recently <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2012.751117?journalCode=pqje20#.Ud-Z2o7BHfB" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2012.751117?journalCode=pqje20#.Ud-Z2o7BHfB">asked</a> two groups of people to answer questions. People in one group were told that before each question, the answer would be briefly flashed on their screens — too quickly to consciously perceive, but slow enough for their unconscious to take it in. The other group was told that the flashes simply signaled the next question. In fact, for both groups, a random string of letters, not the answers, was flashed. But, remarkably, the people who thought the answers were flashed did better on the test. Expecting to know the answers made people more likely to get the answers right.”</p></blockquote>
