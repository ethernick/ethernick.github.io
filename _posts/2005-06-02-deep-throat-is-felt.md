title: "Deep Throat is Felt"

What a quote…only [George](http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/) can get away with saying that in the news.

But in seeing this, it makes me think just a little. Could something like that happen with today’s generations? This is a secret that was kept by 4 people for 30 years. It would have been easy for the reports or the editor just to stand up and give it away, but they “promised” to keep the secret.

I sure as hell don’t have an inkling into an answer, but I sure will ask the question. Do promises and vows still exist?
