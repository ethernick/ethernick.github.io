title: My Personality 2
---
It’s been about 6 months since I did my [previous personality test](/my-personality). Let’s see what’s 
changed...almost nothing

### Jung Type: ENFP (the same)

“Journalist”. Uncanny sense of the motivations of others. Life is an exciting drama. 8.1% of total 
population.

Enneagram: 9 sx/sp/so (the same)

| Type 1 | Perfectionism | ``||||||`` | 26% |
| Type 2 | Helpfulness | ``||||||||||||||||`` | 66% |
| Type 3 | Image Awareness | ``||||||||||||||`` | 60% |
| Type 4 | Sensitivity | ``||||||||||||`` | 46% |
| Type 5 | Detachment | ``||||||||||||||||`` | 66% |
| Type 6 | Anxiety | ``||||||`` | 30% |
| Type 7 | Adventurousness | ``||||||||||||||||`` | 63% |
| Type 8 | Aggressiveness | ``||||||||||||||`` | 60% |
| Type 9 | Calmness | ``||||||||||||||||||||`` | 90% |

(table above: pretty much the same)

Nines are calm, laid-back, and optimistic. They are able to see everyone’s point of view and have a natural 
desire for peace. Nines are effective mediators. Fearful of conflict and separation from others, they may be 
too accommodating.

Your variant is sexual: sx/sp/so

Overall, you score highest on assertive traits (sx), followed by withdrawn traits (sp), and lowest on 
complaint traits (so)
