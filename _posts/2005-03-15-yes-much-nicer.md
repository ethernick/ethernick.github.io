title: Yes...Much Nicer
---
So, since my last little break I’ve been building the site. Yes, PHP is much nicer for me. Although you can’t see it yet ( but don’t worry you will ) the progress is much nicer. In a matter of day’s I’ve made the same progress as a month previously. It has to do with my lack of perl knowledge of course, so there was a learning curve, but still. 1 week to 1 month? Why pay more?

I’ve still got the question of how to manage the listings of course, but I’m putting something together to hopefully make it all work out. Any suggestions, feel free to post them.
