<p>My internet presence has been quiet, but don’t let that fool you to believe I’ve been doing nothing. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>This duality has me thinking about the increase in concern about web pressence. People are watching, and I think because of Facebook, it’s becoming obvious.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcitsa.ca/Services/link.htm">The Link</a>, BCIT’s campus magazine released an interesting article about Facebook’s involvement as a catalyst to and investigation by Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day into the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). Several CBSA recruits posted “compromising images and questionable statements”.</p>
<p>However, I wonder if they posted comments on myspace, if it would be as big of a deal.</p>
<p>Dannah Boyd, a leader in internet sociology, posted a postulation about class systems online. In specific <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html">divisions through Facebook and MySpace</a>.</p>
<p>Myspace is the fringe, where Facebooks Harvard history, garners a more affluent demographic. Her article makes some interesting theories and statements. I recommend the read.</p>
<p>What that means is a CEO that might otherwise not be involved in Myspace, might be more apt to be on Facebook. And as a result, you’re profile could be visible. So, a bender between friends, could be embarrassing pictures your bosses boss would see. An offhand comment between friends, could be grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>This isn’t to make paranoia. Not all corporations as looking over your shoulder, however the more “affluent” or “main-steam” these social sites become, the more like the real world it is. The same rules apply.</p>
<p>If you wouldn’t yell it in a crowd of people … don’t say it on the internet.</p>
