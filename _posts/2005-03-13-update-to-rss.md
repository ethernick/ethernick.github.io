For those of you reading my site using one of my handy dandy feeds, you’ll notice I’ve made a slight alteration. I’ve included the permalink, comment link and trackback.

Over the next little bit I might be making some more alterations. I’m thinking maybe I’ll include things like the category info. I also noticed the the “more” link or “page” links don’t work if the post has them. So I might fix that.

Any problems with any feed, just post a comment somewhere and I’ll work to try and fix it.
