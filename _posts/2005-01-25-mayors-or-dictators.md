title: Mayors or Dictators

The title of my post might be a bit confusing, but let me explain. I started this post with the hopes of creating an idea about how companies can really become a society. By becoming a city, there could be so many positives. But as I though and compared I noticed a potential comparison for another social order. For some it could be scary, and for others it might not be. But take a read and let me know your thoughts.

Are corporations the biggest cross border communists? There seems to be this social statement “booing” and shunning communism: Russia, Cuba, Iraq. So why is it that we allow corporations to act the same? Lets take a look at just one definition of communism.

>A system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people.

**“A system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy...”**

You look at a company and tell me it doesn’t do this. When a company opens, its basic design is to make money. To make money you need to control or at least plan to control you economic corner of the world, regardless of what corner that is.

And as an employee who’s not in the “government” or, should I say “management”, did you plan this control? Did you really have a say in it? Management can take your advice and suggestions but they are the real ones who are creating the plan, regardless of how you feel.

**“...a single, often authoritarian party holds power...”**

Who hires your CEO? Who hires the President of your company? Was there an election? If there was, then wow! Chance are, I’m thinking a small group or “party” made the decision. If not, it was just a single person who said “I am the President”. Even take a look at your management team. Did you put them there or was it their bosses? Power is an interesting conversation. Sure, some could argue that really the employees hold the power, but who do those people allow to use it? I’ve herd people who “had” to stay at the office late because of something their “boss” assigned them. People “having” to do a task which they don’t like. But still waking up in the morning and doing it. No one should have that kind of power. But it happens in corporate culture every day.

**“...claiming to make progress toward a higher social order...”**

There are lots of programs and incentives and tools that companies use to calm their masses. Improvement Teams, An annual review, 360 feedback, they are constantly coming up and devising new and “improved” methods for making the company “flow” better. Terms like “synergy” evolve and Managers and Directors grab onto it like a moth to a flame. Hoping to be able to use this term to maybe claim that they have a form of higher social order. After all, they have “synergy”. Companies need to constantly “claim” to be making improvement in how they “perform”. After all. The better a company performs is a reflection on how organized or ordered their society is…right?

“...which all goods are equally shared by the people.”

That should be amended by “proportionate to how valued your contribution”. Take a look at any dictator. They don’t live in a shack. This is really where the downfall of communism lies. Greed corrupts and eventually the dictator redefines this principle to base it off of who “contributes” better; who they “like” most.

But in the terms of companies, they down right define it at the onset. The value of your contribution is given a dollar amount. Managers or Directors make more because they have a more values contribution. In a sense this dollar value is your share into the “goods” of the company. How many people get Bonus, or Commission. Again, a defined principle to “share” with you the goods that you have help obtain.

**Conclusion**

Now, I’m sure there are gaps in logic, faults in analysis. But, before you approve or disapprove all I ask is that you look at the commonalities for a moment. This thought was a complete accident. Chances are it might have been a thought or theory introduced somewhere else, and if so, I haven’t read it. I was trying to form something else, something better, yet there it was. Staring me in the face and I had to admit, it’s an interesting thought.
