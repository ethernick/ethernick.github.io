<p>I’ve got a case of the “fuck off”‘s – and there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>What’s probably not ideal is how I manage the people around me when I get them. My technique as it stands right now is nothing. I don’t manage at all: I don’t communicate; I don’t acknowledge; I don’t do. Everything around me usually goes into a shit storm and then I’m left with shattered relationships to clean up afterwards.</p>
<p>I need a polite and mass way to tell people I’ve changed my mind. Any expectations you might have had of me, I decided to put on hold until I deem ok to resume.</p>
