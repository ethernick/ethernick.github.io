If, like [Clay Shirky wrote](https://web.archive.org/web/20110102193349/http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html), coming into the information age was like the [gin craze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Craze)
before the industrial age, then we as a society needs to go to AA, because I think we traded Gin for whiskey.
