title: Ode to spring
---
I don’t post enough poetry. Last night we had an exercise in class called, ode to spring, and here is the poem that came from it.

A landscape of white desert  
Nothing but howling of the wind  
being torn by sleeping claws of trees  
Each wooden stump a tombstone  
engraved “2005 A devoted Mother”  
But in this time of rest and death  
the sun conspires with  
the moon, the sky and stars  
And with wiccan like chants  
and native tribal dance  
they splatter the ground with   
a concoction of love  
so powerful to wake the infinite slumber  
And slowly from faded calling  
she claws through the soil  
With sweat and ache   
her joints pop and muscles shake  
Finally she peaks just one finger  
above the ground  
Above her white grave  
And on the fingers tip a bud of pink.
