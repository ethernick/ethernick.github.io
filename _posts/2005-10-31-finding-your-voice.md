title: Finding Your Voice
---
I’ve been looking over the past 121 post’s I’ve done. Reading some of the things I’ve tried and some of the 
topics I’ve tried to discuss. In doing so, I’ve noticed that I really do break one of the most cardinal rules 
of blogging, “pick a topic”. I haven’t done that. I switch backwards and forwards and sway back and forth. In 
a way it’s similar to my life but really what it is, is my own personal struggle to find my voice.

For bands and musicians, they ship them out to foreign countries where no one in the main market can hear 
them. It gives them the opportunity to play; try new thing; fail and succeed. But I’m not shipping myself to 
those countries nor do I have a development fund to try some very expensive failures. For me this blog is my 
way of stretching out and trying.

So although a good blog has a topic, a better one has a writer that the topic resonates with. So for those, 
like me, that are trying, the only thing you can really do, is keep writing. Eventually the voice will come 
out loud and clear.
