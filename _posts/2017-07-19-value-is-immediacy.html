<p>The more we get comfortable in our information age, the more valuable it is for immediacy.</p>

<p>Tidal uses immediacy with invested artists to get subscribers.</p>

<p>Record labels leverage it in negotiations with Spotify.</p>

<p>You want to watch Game of Thrones without spoilers? You've got to watch it sooner.
Maybe you _should_ pay for HBO.</p>
