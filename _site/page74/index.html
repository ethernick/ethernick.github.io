    <p>I was given the task of making a manifeto for class. There was one that fell under the guidlines, and one that didn’t. One that I wanted, and one that I didn’t. This is the one that I didn’t hand in, but the one I’ll use, just for me.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The Same Rules Apply.</b> New Technology isn’t a mystery, just a new medium. The same rules for interacting with people in the 19th century still apply.</li>
<li><b>Dig for the root.</b> Don’t take anything at face value. Always ask “why” or “where it came from”. If you can’t ask any further, then ask someone else.</li>
<li><b>Nothing is new.</b> Recognize that. Respect that.</li>
<li><b>When you understand, you can overlook the details.</b> Having a foundational understanding of why something is, will help you figure out the details later.</li>
<li><b>Details are what set you apart.</b> Everyone can have the same message, but what makes you stand out, are how you say it &amp; more importantly why you say it.</li>
<li><b>The most important words, are in the spaces.</b> Between every word, your true nature slips out.</li>
<li><b>Be a Tumbleweed.</b> Learn to roll with things and look forward. Let the wind cary you, and don’t say no to the experience.</li>
<li><b>Improv Rules.</b> In the world of improvisation, the fastest way to kill a scene is to say “no”.</li>
<li><b>When a baby falls down, it doesn’t get embarrassed.</b> And neither should you. Mistakes are a fact of life, and when it happens, move on.</li>
<li><b>If you show your skeletons, no one else can.</b> Don’t be afraid of the past, show it with pride. Even more, show that you’ve learned from it.</li>
<li><b>Sometimes the only one who knows there was a mistake is you.</b> There are countless Jazz albums where a musician makes a mistake. To the average listener, they don’t hear it. To the trained listener, it adds wonder and flavor.</li>
<li><b>Sharing is caring.</b> Keep sharing with people. Wether it’s one person or a thousand people. Wether they share alike, wether they recognize you or not, they will always remember where they got something from. So will you.</li>
<li><b>If you wouldn’t say it in a crowd, don’t say it.</b> Online or over the airwaves, if your instinct is to whisper, or look over your shoulder, you are not the one who should be talking about it.</li>
<li><b>Someone else can always say it better.</b> Look for them. Give them the recognition they deserve.</li>
<li><b>Shake hands and kiss babies.</b> In everything you do, if you take the extra time to recognize someone, that charity will always come back. Do it wether you are on the clock or not.</li>
<li><b>You have two ears and one mouth.</b> Always listen twice as much as you talk.</li>
<li><b>If you have nothing important to say, don’t say anything.</b> If you can’t contribute to the conversation simply share the conversation. See Sharing is caring.</li>
<li><b>Land it.</b> Everything needs to have a point. Everything needs to have a solid ending. And if you get lost…babies fall down.</li>
<li><b>When all else fails go back to the basics.</b> It’s good to try new things, but when they don’t pan out, keep it simple.</li>
<li><b>Less is more.</b></li>

    <p>You have 10 or more people all tweeting away on a single account, but to those watching are wondering “who’s the one clicking submit”.</p>
<p>It’s easy to add a quick signature to each post, i.e. “^NK”</p>
<p>But if I am a newer listener, or I’ve stumbled across you through a retweet, how am I going to decipher these signatures?</p>
<p>Stumble over to <s><a href="http://twitter.com/cbcradio3">CBC Radio3</a>’s</s> <a href="http://twitter.com/shawhelp">@ShawHelp</a>’s twitter, and you’ll see a great solution. Use the background image. It’s common practice to use the background image to post a logo in the corner, and putting a list of on air talent with their signatures makes it clear.</p>
<p>Remember, you don’t have the entire page.</p>
<p>Because computer screen sizes are different, and there is the twitter logo and tweets to fight against, I would keep the information in a 150px margin. And if you compare Radio 3’s background, I wouldn’t go any lower then theirs.</p>
<p><b>Update April 5, 2012:</b> Look’s like CBC Radio 3 stopped doing it, but <a href="http://twitter.com/shawhelp">@ShawHelp</a> does it.</p>
