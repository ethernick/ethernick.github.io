<p>Vulgar, crass, but so far Californication is entertaining. I think David Duchovny, is good at self deprecating, sad-man roles.</p>

        Horoscopes: Entertainment or advise?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2008</span>

    <p>Astrology is a mixed bag of entertainment and advise. There are those that make these statements that pretty much apply to almost anyone: “You will find something you thought was lost.” So, when you think you’ve lost your key’s and find them again, WOW!</p>
<p>So, why do I even read them?</p>
<p>Sometimes I just need a laugh and a moment of escape. It’s like reading the bus signs on the way to school — you know they won’t be any good, but at least it’s something to do.</p>
<p>Other times, I need something that let’s me know I’m not completely loosing it. But for these times, I don’t just flip open 24 or The Metro.</p>
<p>Introduce, Rob Brezsny. Not only are his horoscopes entertaining buy they’ve got a rare insight and perspective I don’t see anywhere else. Take this week for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sagittarius</p>
<p>Here’s the first thing you need to know about the current state of your destiny: “Everything is blooming most recklessly; if it were voices instead of colors, there would be an unbelievable shrieking into the heart of the night.” That message comes to you from poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Here’s the second piece of wisdom you should take with you everywhere you go. It’s from Vladimir Nabokov: “For aren’t you and I gods? Let all of life be an unfettered howl. Release life’s rapture. Everything is blooming. Everything is flying. Everything is screaming. Laughter. Running.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this right? Well, I’ll leave that for my own craziness. But, just to let you know, I think it is.</p>
<p>Take a look at his site, <a href="http://www.freewillastrology.com/horoscopes">freewillastrology.com/horoscopes</a>. If he doesn’t get it right, at least you’ll have a good moment of escape.</p>

    <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>When I feel the pressure building up I get tunnel vision. I kick into gear and focus on one task at a time. But the longer I have that kind of focus, the more I loose the grand picture. “Why am I doing … ?”, “What’s the point in … ?” You get the idea.</p>
<p>But last week, while scrounging for pennies and food money, a friend reminded me that eggs and potatoes are cheap. Yes they are!</p>
<p>I brought home the groceries and then made some hash browns and poached eggs. I love hash browns and poached eggs!</p>
<p>The minute I sat down with my plate and cut into the eggs, the yellow yokes all runny tasty good. I smiled and for a moment the blinders lifted. The tunnel vision went away and I had a reprieve. I took a big breath. Who knew something so simple could be so powerful for stress relief?</p>
<p>So, do you need a good poached egg? Is there something you might be over looking? A simple pleasure, a simple act, a simple thing that you might be overlooking that could make all the difference?</p>

        An ode to matter-of-fact
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>This is an ode to matter of fact, in fact,<br />
a poem like evidentiary stone and stat.</p>
<p>For one plus one is two, not three,<br />
nor four or five, not twelve, indeed.<br />
Yet, far from mathematic postulations<br />
a soft and chewy sap awaits you.</p>
<p>A fact — In core of belly it sits and stays<br />
your course along a rocky plain or<br />
maybe through clear, already trodden path<br />
your feet, no matter, will eat their grass.</p>
<p>And if along the way that path does stray,<br />
your course, with force of will,<br />
shall tumble trees and shatter shale.<br />
What makes this “matter of fact” is inner still</p>
<p>“It is what is”, a need, a must,<br />
a “way it goes.” It thrusts<br />
from nock to tip, the target knows.<br />
Your life in sight, to loose, is right.</p>
<p>Some may ask “what is”, “what might”<br />
You disregard their shallow sight.<br />
Can light escape universal grip?<br />
Do elk or emu fret and flick?</p>
<p>I am what I am, no ands ifs or buts.<br />
I do what I do, no quips or bumps.<br />
Like one and one is two not fifteen<br />
I do what I do, matter of fact,  I’m me.</p>
