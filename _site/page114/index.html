        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/be-a-detective">Be a Detective</a></h3>
        <p>I’m a liar. Not to friends and family, but I lie to myself. We all have done it. It’s the power and beauty of denial. The best part about it is we aren’t even aware of it. And when one is engaged in the act of personal development it will happen. You will be thrown off track by a faulty lead. Perhaps even more then just one.</p>
<p>Denial is a great tool to be able to live day-by-day. It’s all part of the survivor instincts. Why wallow on something or some part of you when you are being chased or when you should be hunting to feed your family. It’s counter productive. But then again their are times when you should confront it, because the issue in itself is causing counter productivity.</p>
<p>Denial is like a criminal. Some disguise themselves in suites and smiles. Others tend to be more vicious and seedy. Yours is just as diverse. Memories are altered for protection; false observations are made to make you feel better. So to cut through all of this, we need to treat ourselves like a cop would treat a suspect. The law is blind. It uses fact, and so should you. If your answers are arbitrary or vague, come up with proof. In business they have a 360 survey. They ask direct reports, peers and leaders about one person, you. And somewhere in the middle of all the questions, the truth is born. For you, create a case file. My own personal case file is becoming more like a mystery everyday. There are new suspects popping up, key suspects are changing and new plot lines being discovered all the time. I’ve even been the key suspect several times.</p>
<p>Some of you feel that you are like Shaft ,Columbo or Kojak and are the lone detective cracking the case. But for some, the lone wolf path isn’t right. Don’t be afraid to find a partner; don’t be afraid to admit, “I can’t do this alone”. After all, when you are one of the suspects, how could you trust all of your own answers?</p>
<p>My one bit of advise is to find someone neutral. We would all like to have our family and loved ones be our partner. But sometimes, through their best interest and projections, they throw in some curve balls themselves. This is why counselors and coaches exists. These are people who care about your well being, but understand the fine line. They are professional detectives.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you decide to handle your own denial, keep in mind it’s there. Although my analogy could help look at it more objectively, don’t beat yourself up. There is no need to lock yourself in an interrogation room. The act of questioning is enough. The act of realizing that you can lie will open up a new possibility in finding out who you really are. The act of asking the tough questions is all it takes to unlock your own mystery.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/embrace-the-dark">Embrace the Dark</a></h3>
        <p>No, this isn’t a post about wax voodoo dolls and needles.</p>
<p>With the Ying there must be Yang. Both must exist. It’s been a lesson that has existed for thousands of years. There must be dark and light in each of us; there must be good and bad. Nature is full of examples. Here are just a couple:</p>
<p>Owl, Scorpion, Snake, Vulture, Spider, Crow</p>
<p>Each of these animals in one religion or another have gotten a bad rap. They are “evil” or the bringers of death. Watch out! But in fact, each of them have lessons we can learn from. Lessons we need to succeed. Maybe even excel.</p>
<p>Take for example the act of “not caring”. The phrase in itself is difficult for some who have not embraced their dark. A simple act of not caring or even feeling indifferent to people can be a challenge. To people who want to be completely “good”, they might find themselves looking for a “win-win” outcome. They might go out of their way to accommodate others feelings, in turn, distorting the original vision. They could obsess over others feelings to the point where they take perfectly good energy away from the task at hand.</p>
<p>Trying to be “good” comes from years of childhood training.</p>
<p>“Treat others as you would be treated” - what about not treating them at all?</p>
<p>“Be courteous to your neighbour” - what about the asshole downstairs who likes to blare rock opera?</p>
<p>“Never speak before spoken to” - well how do I talk to someone who never talks to me?</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of “good” and “bad” ( hence all the quotes ). Reason is because there is so much more to it. In the classical sense of “good”, one must be a drone or sheep. They must follow the herd and never look back. And if anyone wants a little lime light, a little success - they must turn around and walk the other way. Be the black sheep ( some say purple cow ). Embrace your dark.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/coffee-the-brainwasher">Coffee the brainwasher</a></h3>
        <p>Get it…wash? It’s a liquid! Get it?</p>
<p>Not sure if this is a good thing or not. An <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9280&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20">article on NewScientist.com</a> states “Drinking coffee makes you more open-minded” and on one hand that’s a good thing. But then goes on to say, “Moderate doses of caffeine can also make you more easily convinced by arguments that go against your beliefs”</p>
<p>Hun?</p>
<p>It’s good to be open minded, but “easily convinced”? For someone who drinks it religiously and addictively, does that make me flexible or someone that can be walked over? Does that make me adjustable or a hindu cow? Am I addicted to the caffeine or the relaxed perspective it gives me?</p>
<p>I know of some other substances that help people be open minded as well.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/business-lessons-from-geekness">Business Lessons From Geekness</a></h3>
        <p>Late last night watching the Season 1 finale of Stargate: Atlantis ( I said Geekness ), One of the characters, Dr McKay, was frustrated by the bull headed leaders.</p>
<p>“They always say they don’t need the scientists until they need the scientists. By then it’s too late!” ( or something like that )</p>
<p>It’s not just on T.V. It’s not just “the scientists”. You can replace that with just about anything. Give it a try.</p>
<p><b>They always say they don’t need food until they need food. By then it’s too late!</b></p>
<p><b>They always say they don’t need <i>it</i> until they need <i>it</i>. By then it’s too late!</b></p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/the-right-tools">The Right Tools</a></h3>
        <p>For any job one must do, you need to have the right tools to do it. For Piano players it evident, that if there is no piano, they can’t play. For writers, no pen and paper, no typewriter, no computer, there won’t be a story.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on this for a little for myself. Asking, what tools do I need to be creative. What tools do I need that would help. And although on the surface to those who don’t write, or those who don’t play piano, these would be accurate statements. Any pen and any keyboard should do. But as I continue to write, and continue to play piano I’m finding that there is more to that.</p>
<p>When I write, it’s not just any pen or any paper that would do. I need a flavor mini pen with an orange grip and a <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/">Moleskine</a> small lined notebook.</p>
<p>When I play the piano, I can no longer use just a simple Casio keyboard I got from radio shack, I need to have weight in the keys from either a high quality electronic piano, or even more preferably a baby grand.</p>
<p>Being creative incorporates all your experiences and all your senses. So it makes sense that you need to incorporate them all in your creative tools. They must smell right, feel right, sound right, look right, and taste right ( perhaps for chef’s or maybe you need to chew the right kind of gum ).</p>
<p>So if you are looking for your right tools, don’t just look for something that will “do”. Look for something that inspires.</p>
