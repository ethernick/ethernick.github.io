    <p>At my company, the executive team is trying to boast that the company promotes “Open and timely communication”. However, their is a downfall in their support of this.</p>
<p><b>1. If you going to say “and”, do “and”.</b></p>
<p>The word “and” is a tricky one. Especially with value statements like this one. The word implies that both are present, and always present together. If you are timely with a piece of information but not very open, then you have failed in putting the statement into practice.</p>
<p>If you fail, then you loose the trust of those you’ve informed. And all of a sudden, there is miss-trust or the idea that you aren’t being honest. The value looses it’s meaning and simply become more clutter in corporate propaganda, then is rejected from the masses</p>
<p><b>2. Simple acts show your sincerity</b></p>
<p>Ah, there’s the rub! Really, this is the main reason I’m writing, and my big bug. Our office has just been renovated to follow the corporate scheme. And suddenly I noticed a inconspicuous door with a security swipe key. I looked through the small window and what do I see? It’s an almost secret executive only area.</p>
<p>Hmmm, “open and timely communication”. Open? How does a secret locked away executive only area say “Open” to the employees.</p>
<p>For offices that are multiple floors, I can understand that there might be a floor dedicated. But in out 2 floor small operation, the message this say’s speaks volumes!</p>
<p>You can say it, but your actions have just convinced me, you don’t believe it, you don’t want to believe it. And, sorry big wig exec, I don’t believe you.</p>

    <p>This week, I’ve been feeling drained. With some reflection and thought, I think I have an idea why. The amount of things I’m doing that drain energy from me don’t equal the amount of things that rejuvenate me.</p>
<p>Everyday I’m loosing energy. It’s bad accounting!</p>
<p><b>Rejuvenate &gt;= Drain!</b></p>
<p>It has me thinking, what drains me and what gives me energy? I’m wondering how to balance the energy books. Is it a todo list like GTD? Is is something different?</p>

    <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>I’ve been doing work around a personal aversion to the phrase “have to”. When I hear it, and especially when said to me, I always react “I don’t have to do anything”.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone “has to” do anything.</p>
<p>I say let’s use more descriptive “need to”, “should”, “obligated”, “would like to”. All of which are different then “have to”.</p>
<p>So why? Well, I believe this term is used and beaten with a stick. It’s a dead horse, so I suggest, let’s all get off.</p>
<p>“Have to” came around at the end of the 16th century, which is the end of the Renaissance. Is it a coincidence that for a time when everyone is running around the countryside asking “why”, that people came up with “because you have to”? They wanted a way to shut them up.</p>
<p>It’s used as a blanket statement for people who don’t know, or don’t want to know. It’s used for people who want compliance.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><b>Person 1:</b> “You have to [insert task here]”</p>
<p><b>Person 2:</b> “Why?”</p>
<p><b>Person 1:</b> “Because, you have to.”</p>

    <p><i>Wrote an interesting little piece in creative class the other day. It was a moment when you hear the characters voice crisply, and it’s more dictation. Especially this, which was an odd mix of slang. Wasn’t sure what I was writing until I looked it over again.</i></p>
<p>The telephone rang. I looked at the call display to see who it was</p>
<p>“Oh - My - God! Like, you totally won’t believe!”</p>
<p>I saw the number, I saw the name, and yet I sill picked up the phone. Why?</p>
<p>“So Dave went to Lisa’s and totally found her tets up and snoggin Janet. She was like shocked. And he was like, shocked!”</p>
<p>Why? You’d think after a lifetime of listing to your little sister dish all the latest gossip, the voice wouldn’t sound like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p>“He asked if he could play too, but she just slammed palm on his specs. I mean, It ain’t pussy foot it they tri’d. But, you need a reboot on her thoughts. I mean seriously - with out her monkey toy it ain’t banana cream; it’s just pie.”</p>
<p>Half the time I had no clue. Where does she get these terms?</p>
<p>“Turns out she’s been fakin his grades for a semester. He ain’t her localhost and she’s changed providers! Hell she’s gone from packet to ping! We are talkin, like some serious backbone overhaul.”</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>“So, like, he went from hotmail to gmail, re-proped his DNS and is looking for a new server.”</p>
<p>With that she hung up the phone. What did she say?</p>
