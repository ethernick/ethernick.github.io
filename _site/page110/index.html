        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/horoscopes-entertainment-or-advise">Horoscopes: Entertainment or advise?</a></h3>
        <p>Astrology is a mixed bag of entertainment and advise. There are those that make these statements that pretty much apply to almost anyone: “You will find something you thought was lost.” So, when you think you’ve lost your key’s and find them again, WOW!</p>
<p>So, why do I even read them?</p>
<p>Sometimes I just need a laugh and a moment of escape. It’s like reading the bus signs on the way to school — you know they won’t be any good, but at least it’s something to do.</p>
<p>Other times, I need something that let’s me know I’m not completely loosing it. But for these times, I don’t just flip open 24 or The Metro.</p>
<p>Introduce, Rob Brezsny. Not only are his horoscopes entertaining buy they’ve got a rare insight and perspective I don’t see anywhere else. Take this week for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sagittarius</p>
<p>Here’s the first thing you need to know about the current state of your destiny: “Everything is blooming most recklessly; if it were voices instead of colors, there would be an unbelievable shrieking into the heart of the night.” That message comes to you from poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Here’s the second piece of wisdom you should take with you everywhere you go. It’s from Vladimir Nabokov: “For aren’t you and I gods? Let all of life be an unfettered howl. Release life’s rapture. Everything is blooming. Everything is flying. Everything is screaming. Laughter. Running.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this right? Well, I’ll leave that for my own craziness. But, just to let you know, I think it is.</p>
<p>Take a look at his site, <a href="http://www.freewillastrology.com/horoscopes">freewillastrology.com/horoscopes</a>. If he doesn’t get it right, at least you’ll have a good moment of escape.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/remember-the-simple-things">Remember the simple things</a></h3>
        <p>When I feel the pressure building up I get tunnel vision. I kick into gear and focus on one task at a time. But the longer I have that kind of focus, the more I loose the grand picture. “Why am I doing … ?”, “What’s the point in … ?” You get the idea.</p>
<p>But last week, while scrounging for pennies and food money, a friend reminded me that eggs and potatoes are cheap. Yes they are!</p>
<p>I brought home the groceries and then made some hash browns and poached eggs. I love hash browns and poached eggs!</p>
<p>The minute I sat down with my plate and cut into the eggs, the yellow yokes all runny tasty good. I smiled and for a moment the blinders lifted. The tunnel vision went away and I had a reprieve. I took a big breath. Who knew something so simple could be so powerful for stress relief?</p>
<p>So, do you need a good poached egg? Is there something you might be over looking? A simple pleasure, a simple act, a simple thing that you might be overlooking that could make all the difference?</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/an-ode-to-matter-of-fact">An ode to matter-of-fact</a></h3>
        <p>This is an ode to matter of fact, in fact,<br />
a poem like evidentiary stone and stat.</p>
<p>For one plus one is two, not three,<br />
nor four or five, not twelve, indeed.<br />
Yet, far from mathematic postulations<br />
a soft and chewy sap awaits you.</p>
<p>A fact — In core of belly it sits and stays<br />
your course along a rocky plain or<br />
maybe through clear, already trodden path<br />
your feet, no matter, will eat their grass.</p>
<p>And if along the way that path does stray,<br />
your course, with force of will,<br />
shall tumble trees and shatter shale.<br />
What makes this “matter of fact” is inner still</p>
<p>“It is what is”, a need, a must,<br />
a “way it goes.” It thrusts<br />
from nock to tip, the target knows.<br />
Your life in sight, to loose, is right.</p>
<p>Some may ask “what is”, “what might”<br />
You disregard their shallow sight.<br />
Can light escape universal grip?<br />
Do elk or emu fret and flick?</p>
<p>I am what I am, no ands ifs or buts.<br />
I do what I do, no quips or bumps.<br />
Like one and one is two not fifteen<br />
I do what I do, matter of fact,  I’m me.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/citizenship">Citizenship</a></h3>
        <p>If countries put as much effort into Citizenship as Companies put into performance reviews, maybe there would be 100% citizen participation.</p>
<p>Canada needs an HR department.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking with classmates who don’t get the point of Goals setting and value statements. All the stuff that every corporate machine goes through: Annual review, quarterly updates with your manager, progress reports. Everything that connects the employee’s to the business.</p>
<p>Then the tough occurred, that all these tools are to connect each employee and “try” to make them “care” and participate in the company. What if tax time was more then “taxes”. What if it was also a performance review of citizenship?</p>
<p>What are your goals as a citizen?<br />
Have you succeeded in meeting those goals?</p>
<p>Maybe based on our goals and the success of helping the countries goals, each citizen could get a bonus?</p>
<p>Maybe some sort of success multiplier?</p>
