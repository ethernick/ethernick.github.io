    <p>If countries put as much effort into Citizenship as Companies put into performance reviews, maybe there would be 100% citizen participation.</p>
<p>Canada needs an HR department.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking with classmates who don’t get the point of Goals setting and value statements. All the stuff that every corporate machine goes through: Annual review, quarterly updates with your manager, progress reports. Everything that connects the employee’s to the business.</p>
<p>Then the tough occurred, that all these tools are to connect each employee and “try” to make them “care” and participate in the company. What if tax time was more then “taxes”. What if it was also a performance review of citizenship?</p>
<p>What are your goals as a citizen?<br />
Have you succeeded in meeting those goals?</p>
<p>Maybe based on our goals and the success of helping the countries goals, each citizen could get a bonus?</p>
<p>Maybe some sort of success multiplier?</p>

    <p>My internet presence has been quiet, but don’t let that fool you to believe I’ve been doing nothing. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>This duality has me thinking about the increase in concern about web pressence. People are watching, and I think because of Facebook, it’s becoming obvious.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcitsa.ca/Services/link.htm">The Link</a>, BCIT’s campus magazine released an interesting article about Facebook’s involvement as a catalyst to and investigation by Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day into the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). Several CBSA recruits posted “compromising images and questionable statements”.</p>
<p>However, I wonder if they posted comments on myspace, if it would be as big of a deal.</p>
<p>Dannah Boyd, a leader in internet sociology, posted a postulation about class systems online. In specific <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html">divisions through Facebook and MySpace</a>.</p>
<p>Myspace is the fringe, where Facebooks Harvard history, garners a more affluent demographic. Her article makes some interesting theories and statements. I recommend the read.</p>
<p>What that means is a CEO that might otherwise not be involved in Myspace, might be more apt to be on Facebook. And as a result, you’re profile could be visible. So, a bender between friends, could be embarrassing pictures your bosses boss would see. An offhand comment between friends, could be grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>This isn’t to make paranoia. Not all corporations as looking over your shoulder, however the more “affluent” or “main-steam” these social sites become, the more like the real world it is. The same rules apply.</p>
<p>If you wouldn’t yell it in a crowd of people … don’t say it on the internet.</p>

    <p>There is an interesting aspect of my new radio life which was raised and addressed by one of my instructors. No longer are we targets of the media, now we need to take a step out and become part of it.</p>
<p>We are being asked to look at news and media in new and very critical ways. Not just advertisements, but announcing and news. How are the words we hear in the media spoken. What are the messages between breathes? As many actors are aware - there is a lot of work and preparation to make someone else’s words, natural and your own.</p>
<p>One of the tasks we are asked is to become sponges and read / watch and listen to news. I myself am not a big fan of the news in the first place, so this study will be quite an interesting experience. Maybe in this time, I’ll be able to put words as to why I’m not connected with the news. Who knows, with the right work, I could make a difference in it.</p>
