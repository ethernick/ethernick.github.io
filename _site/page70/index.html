<p><b>How to explain RadioDNS</b></p>
<p>I was listening to a podcast ( I won’t name which one ), and the engineers were explaining what <a href="http://radiodns.org">RadioDNS</a> is. 30 minutes later everyone was confused.</p>
<p><b>Because DNS ain’t that special for the web, let me explain.</b></p>
<p>Think of your friend Tom’s phone number.</p>
<p>What just happened? You translated Tom’s name into a number. Easy right? Well, if you have thousands of numbers what do you do? You add it into you phone or a better name you “Rolodex”. Remember those? the big spinning wheels of paper?</p>
<p>Well for the web, it’s no different. When you type in a domain name, DNS hunts through the rolodex to find the phone number. And returns it. Voila! You have dialed up the right computer and have a web page.</p>
<p>What makes DNS a littler different, is imagine being able to share rolodexes and make copies of rolodexes? Well, DNS does this all the time. They share lists throughout the word. So when it doesn’t have a number for the domain you’ve typed, It’ll should out, “hey, does anyone know <a href="http://www.ethernick.com">www.ethernick.com</a>?” Someone will answer and again, Voila again! You have dialed up the right computer and have a web page.</p>
<p><b>RadioDNS?</b></p>
<p>With mobile phones and car radios there is more opportunity to combine the web and the radio broadcast. So RadioDNS got the great idea, let’s translate your radio station into a website with the same rolodex system.</p>
<p><b>RadioDNS translates radio to website address, DNS translates website address into computer phone numbers.</b></p>
<p>The website address can then be displayed in any number of ways.</p>
<p><b>Why should you care?</b></p>
<p>I want to say, because it’s cool, but that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>What if, while someone is listening to your radio station they can get a one time coupon to a restaurant. Or how about seeing a map with the location of the promotions team. Or how about a custom contest, or survey or feedback, or latest tweet or latest blog post. Maybe while you announcer is talking about something they could put up a picture, or direct link to a website. Or maybe…</p>
<p><b>You get the point.</b></p>
<p>Adding the web to your existing radio broadcast has loads of opportunities. And RadioDNS could make it happen.</p>

        Why have 1 stream, when you can have 100?

    <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2010</span>

    <p><a title="Stream of light, stream of water" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/23209605@N00/2786126623/in/set-72157625798630740" data-flickr-embed="true"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3007/2786126623_7cf1dfdb09_z.jpg" alt="Stream of light, stream of water" width="640" height="427" /></a><script src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I’ve talked about streams before, but this is about audio streams.</p>
<p><b>Why have 1 stream, when you can have 100?</b></p>
<p>The idea has been sitting in my post drafts for a while, and I have yet to flush it out. Finally I thought I might as well get it out there. Bear with the stream of thought.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that Music Directors hold back their true dream of airing the ultimate playlist, because frankly, the station they work for would bomb. It would move the music from Major Market Mainstream, into a fringe like love, like art. This juggle is, for me, a fascinating part of the job.</p>
<p>Technology might have the solutions. Take a look at soma.fm - how many streams are coming out of one place? And then I saw <a href="http://www.hear2.com/2010/04/how-to-monetize-your-online-streams.html">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.whatgives.com/2010/05/12/quantity-vs-quality-the-twitter-follower-debate/">this</a>, and mixed it with some thoughts on the<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">BBC</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Downfall ( or at least confusion )</b></p>
<p>The one problem I can see with having all these streams is how do you legally pay for them? I’ve been going through SOCAN and it looks like for additional streams you’re looking at a cost per downloaded podcast, and a cost per streaming listener. If you do the math ( which I have yet to figure out ), it could be substantial.</p>
<p><b>The Opportunity</b></p>
<p>And yet, think of the possibility to sell more! You could sell time specifically to these niche streams. Catering a finer demographic. Creating more engaged listeners. Hell, why not create advertising bundles, for a small percent increase you can by time on the main broadcast and sub-streams.</p>
<p><b>The Logistics</b></p>
<p>How would this look, and would this take listeners away from the main broadcast? Why would you care? If you’re brand is associated to the stream, and people relate you with good music and good content, then all the better. And if that means only 5 people are listening to your MD’s specialized stream, then so be it.</p>
<p>Plus, think of the “VIP” opportunities you could give people through the additional streams? Find out about music survey’s, win special tickets, engage with the station in ways that makes it special to them.</p>
<p>My brain is still swimming through idea’s, and like I said, it’s only half thought out. But take it as it is, or add to it with comments.</p>
